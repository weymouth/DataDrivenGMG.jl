	abstract = {It remains unclear to what extent inviscid added-mass theory accounts for the forces exerted on an accelerating body subjected to separated flow. In this study, reactant forces and velocity-field data are systematically acquired using experimental measurements and simulations of an accelerating circular flat plate. Cases accelerated from rest are compared to cases accelerated from a steady flow state. When the added-mass forces predicted by potential theory and the resistance forces associated with the instantaneous plate velocity are accounted for, the remaining (residual) forces comprise approximately 20% of the peak force, even at high accelerations. In addition, the computed residual forces during accelerations both from rest and steady-state cases yield good collapse with respect to one another, indicating that the total forces are not a strong function of the initial state of the wake. These results suggests that inviscid added-mass theory is inadequate to predict the full reactant force even in the `ideal' condition of impulsive motion from rest.},

	abstract = { This technical note presents a simplified method for quantifying the added mass of the soil that is mobilised as part of the failure mechanism around a foundation during rapid loading, and the resulting additional soil resistance. This note focuses on the solutions for an embedded plate anchor, which is a potential foundation system for offshore floating facilities. In current practice, only the shear strength of the soil surrounding the foundation is considered in calculations of the ultimate bearing capacity. However, the solutions presented in this technical note show that the added mass of the soil involved in the failure mechanism around the foundation can result in a significant increase in ultimate bearing capacity during extreme dynamic wave loading events. These lead to snatch loads transmitted to the anchoring and mooring system, which are high but brief. The technical note provides a general approach applicable to all foundation types, and illustrates the effect of the added mass term and the additional capacity for an embedded plate anchor with typical input conditions. },

@article{Font2021,
	abstract = {Simulations of turbulent fluid flow around long cylindrical structures are computationally expensive because of the vast range of length scales, requiring simplifications such as dimensional reduction. Current dimensionality reduction techniques such as strip-theory and depth-averaged methods do not take into account the natural flow dissipation mechanism inherent in the small-scale three-dimensional (3-D) vortical structures. We propose a novel flow decomposition based on a local spanwise average of the flow, yielding the spanwise-averaged Navier--Stokes (SANS) equations. The SANS equations include closure terms accounting for the 3-D effects otherwise not considered in 2-D formulations. A supervised machine-learning (ML) model based on a deep convolutional neural network provides closure to the SANS system. A-priori results show up to 92% correlation between target and predicted closure terms; more than an order of magnitude better than the eddy viscosity model correlation. The trained ML model is also assessed for different Reynolds regimes and body shapes to the training case where, despite some discrepancies in the shear-layer region, high correlation values are still observed. The new SANS equations and ML closure model are also used for a-posteriori prediction. While we find evidence of known stability issues with long time ML predictions for dynamical systems, the closed SANS simulations are still capable of predicting wake metrics and induced forces with errors from 1-10%. This results in approximately an order of magnitude improvement over standard 2-D simulations while reducing the computational cost of 3-D simulations by 99.5%.},

@article{Zurman-Nasution2021RSI,
	abstract = { The importance of the leading-edge sweep angle of propulsive surfaces used by unsteady swimming and flying animals has been an issue of debate for many years, spurring studies in biology, engineering, and robotics with mixed conclusions. In this work, we provide results from three-dimensional simulations on single-planform finite foils undergoing tail-like (pitch-heave) and flipper-like (twist-roll) kinematics for a range of sweep angles covering a substantial portion of animals while carefully controlling all other parameters. Our primary finding is the negligible 0.043 maximum correlation between the sweep angle and the propulsive force and power for both tail-like and flipper-like motions. This indicates that fish tails and mammal flukes with similar range and size can have a large range of potential sweep angles without significant negative propulsive impact. Although there is a slight benefit to avoiding large sweep angles, this is easily compensated by adjusting the fin's motion parameters such as flapping frequency, amplitude and maximum angle of attack to gain higher thrust and efficiency. },

@article{Muscutt2017PRSB,
	abstract = {The extinct ocean-going plesiosaurs were unique within vertebrates because they used two flipper pairs identical in morphology for propulsion. Although fossils of these Mesozoic marine reptiles have been known for more than two centuries, the function and dynamics of their tandem-flipper propulsion system has always been unclear and controversial. We address this question quantitatively for the first time in this study, reporting a series of precisely controlled water tank experiments that use reconstructed plesiosaur flippers scaled from well-preserved fossils. Our aim was to determine which limb movements would have resulted in the most efficient and effective propulsion. We show that plesiosaur hind flippers generated up to 60\% more thrust and 40\% higher efficiency when operating in harmony with their forward counterparts, when compared with operating alone, and the spacing and relative motion between the flippers was critical in governing these increases. The results of our analyses show that this phenomenon was probably present across the whole range of plesiosaur flipper motion and resolves the centuries-old debate about the propulsion style of these marine reptiles, as well as indicating why they retained two pairs of flippers for more than 100 million years.},

@article{Gomez2016,
	abstract = {A novel method to estimate unsteady aerodynamic force coefficients from pointwise velocity measurements is presented. As opposed to other existing methodologies, time-resolved full velocity fields are not required. The methodology is based on a resolvent-based reduced-order model which requires the mean flow to obtain physical flow structures and pointwise measurement to calibrate their amplitudes. A computationally affordable time-stepping methodology to obtain resolvent modes in non-trivial flow domains is introduced and compared with previous existing matrix-free and matrix-forming strategies. The technique is applied to the unsteady flow around an inclined square cylinder at low Reynolds number. The potential of the methodology is demonstrated through good agreement between the fluctuating pressure distribution on the cylinder and the temporal evolution of the unsteady lift and drag coefficients predicted by the model and those computed by direct numerical simulation.},

	abstract = {A data-driven system-identification technique is explored for proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based reduced-order unsteady simulation integrated with time-resolved particle-image-velocimetry/particle-tracking-velocimetry (PIV/PTV) feedback. Principal interaction pattern analysis is extended to calculate a nonlinear transfer function for the POD-mode evolution. Compared with the transfer function derived from the Galerkin projection of the Navier--Stokes equation, instability is suppressed in this approach by introducing a specific norm to be minimized. A feedback loop is implemented such that multiple POD modes obtained by the snapshot method can be stably tracked and assimilated into the PIV/PTV measurement over time. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated by solving a planar-jet problem at                                                                           {\$}{\$}Re {\backslash}approx 2{\{},{\}}000{\$}{\$}                                                                                    R                        e                        {\^a}                        2                        ,                        000                                                                            .

The method is the compressible extension of the boundary data immersion method (BDIM, Maertens &amp; Weymouth (2015)). The \{BDIM\} equations for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations are derived and the accuracy of the method for the hydrodynamic representation of solid bodies is demonstrated with challenging test cases, including a fully turbulent boundary layer flow and a supersonic instability wave. In addition we show that the compressible \{BDIM\} is able to accurately represent noise radiation from moving bodies and flow induced noise generation without any penalty in allowable time step. },

@article{Giorgio-Serchi2016,
	abstractnote = {A submerged body subject to a sudden shape change experiences large forces due to the variation of added-mass energy. While this phenomenon has been studied for single actuation events, application to sustained propulsion requires the study of periodic shape change. We do so in this work by investigating a spring--mass oscillator submerged in quiescent fluid subject to periodic changes in its volume. We develop an analytical model to investigate the relationship between added-mass variation and viscous damping, and demonstrate its range of application with fully coupled fluid--solid Navier--Stokes simulations at large Stokes number. Our results demonstrate that the recovery of added-mass kinetic energy can be used to completely cancel the viscous damping of the fluid, driving the onset of sustained oscillations with amplitudes as large as four times the average body radius $r_{0}$. A quasi-linear relationship is found to link the terminal amplitude of the oscillations $X$ to the extent of size change $a$, with $X/a$ peaking at values from 4 to 4.75 depending on the details of the shape-change kinematics. In addition, it is found that pumping in the frequency range of $1-a/2r_{0}, with ${it\omega}/{\it\omega}_{n}$ being the ratio between frequency of actuation and natural frequency, is required for sustained oscillations. The results of this analysis shed light on the role of added-mass recovery in the context of shape-changing bodies and biologically inspired underwater vehicles.},

@article{Provini2014,
	abstract = {Transitions to and from the air are critical for aerial locomotion and likely shaped the evolution of flying animals. Research on take-off demonstrates that legs generate greater body accelerations compared to wings, and thereby contribute more to initial flight velocity. Here, we explore coordination between wings and legs in two species with different wingbeat styles, and quantified force production of these modules during the final phase of landing. The same birds we studied during take-off were used: zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata, n=4) and diamond dove (Geopelia cuneata, n=3). We measured kinematics using high-speed video, aerodynamics using particle image velocimetry, and ground-reaction forces using a perch mounted on a force-plate. In contrast with the first three wingbeats of take-off, the final four wingbeats during landing featured ~2 times greater force production. Thus, wings contribute proportionally more to changes in velocity during the last phase of landing compared with the initial phase of take-off. Both species touched down at the same velocity (~1 m/s), but they exhibited significant differences in timing of their final wingbeat relative to touchdown. The ratio of average wing force to peak leg force was greater in doves than finches. Peak ground reaction forces during landing were ~50% of those during take-off, consistent with the birds being motivated to control landing. Likewise, estimations of mechanical energy flux for both species indicate wings produce 3-10 times more mechanical work within the final wingbeats of flight compared with the kinetic energy of the body absorbed by legs during ground contact.},

	abstract = {Soft robotics is a challenging and promising branch of robotics. It can drive significant improvements across various fields of traditional robotics, and contribute solutions to basic problems such as locomotion and manipulation in unstructured environments. A challenging task for soft robotics is to build and control soft robots able to exert effective forces. In recent years, biology has inspired several solutions to such complex problems. This study aims at investigating the smart solution that the Octopus vulgaris adopts to perform a crawling movement, with the same limbs used for grasping and manipulation. An ad hoc robot was designed and built taking as a reference a biological hypothesis on crawling. A silicone arm with cables embedded to replicate the functionality of the arm muscles of the octopus was built. This novel arm is capable of pushing-based locomotion and object grasping, mimicking the movements that octopuses adopt when crawling. The results support the biological observations and clearly show a suitable way to build a more complex soft robot that, with minimum control, can perform diverse tasks.},

@article{Bartol2009,
	abstract = {The dynamics of pulsed jetting in squids throughout ontogeny is not well understood, especially with regard to the development of vortex rings, which are common features of mechanically generated jet pulses (also known as starting jets). Studies of mechanically generated starting jets have revealed a limiting principle for vortex ring formation characterized in terms of a {\textquoteleft}formation number{\textquoteright} (F), which delineates the transition between the formation of isolated vortex rings and vortex rings that have {\textquoteleft}pinched off{\textquoteright} from the generating jet. Near F, there exists an optimum in pulse-averaged thrust with (potentially) low energetic cost, raising the question: do squids produce vortex rings and if so, do they fall near F, where propulsive benefits presumably occur? To better understand vortex ring dynamics and propulsive jet efficiency throughout ontogeny, brief squid Lolliguncula brevis ranging from 3.3 to 9.1 cm dorsal mantle length (DML) and swimming at speeds of 2.43{\textendash}22.2 cms{\textendash}1 (0.54{\textendash}3.50 DMLs{\textendash}1) were studied using digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). A range of jet structures were observed but most structures could be classified as variations of two principal jet modes: (1) jet mode I, where the ejected fluid rolled up into an isolated vortex ring; and (2) jet mode II, where the ejected fluid developed into a leading vortex ring that separated or {\textquoteleft}pinched off{\textquoteright} from a long trailing jet. The ratio of jet length [based on the vorticity extent (Lω)] to jet diameter [based on peak vorticity locations (Dω)] was \&lt;3.0 for jet mode I and\&gt; 3.0 for jet mode II, placing the transition between modes in rough agreement with F determined in mechanical jet studies. Jet mode II produced greater time-averaged thrust and lift forces and was the jet mode most heavily used whereas jet mode I had higher propulsive efficiency, lower slip, shorter jet periods and a higher frequency of fin activity associated with it. No relationship between Lω/Dω and speed was detected and there was no apparent speed preference for the jet modes within the speed range considered in this study; however, propulsive efficiency did increase with speed partly because of a reduction in slip and jet angle with speed. Trends in higher slip, lower propulsive efficiency and higher relative lift production were observed for squid \&lt;5.0 cm DML compared with squid >=5.0 cm DML. While these trends were observed when jet mode I and II were equally represented among the size classes, there was also greater relative dependence on jet mode I than jet mode II for squid \&lt;5.0 cm DML when all of the available jet sequences were examined. Collectively, these results indicate that \~{}5.0 cm DML is an important ontogenetic transition for the hydrodynamics of pulsed jetting in squids. The significance of our findings is that from early juvenile through to adult life stages, L. brevis is capable of producing a diversity of vortex ring-based jet structures, ranging from efficient short pulses to high-force longer duration pulses. Given that some of these structures had Lω/Dωs near F, and F represented the delineation between the two primary jet modes observed, fluid dynamics probably played an integral role in the evolution of squid locomotive systems. When this flexibility in jet dynamics is coupled with the highly versatile fins, which are capable of producing multiple hydrodynamic modes as well, it is clear that squid have a locomotive repertoire far more complex than originally thought.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT The purpose of this paper is to study the basic principle of fish propulsion. As a simplified model, the two-dimensional potential flow over a waving plate of finite chord is treated. The solid plate, assumed to be flexible and thin, is capable of performing the motion which consists of a progressing wave of given wavelength and phase velocity along the chord, the envelope of the wave train being an arbitrary function of the distance from the leading edge. The problem is solved by applying the general theory for oscillating deformable airfoils. The thrust, power required, and the energy imparted to the wake are calculated, and the propulsive efficiency is also evaluated. As a numerical example, the waving motion with linearly varying amplitude is carried out in detail. Finally, the basic mechanism of swimming is elucidated by applying the principle of action and reaction. },

@article{Uldrick1968,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT This paper presents some recent theoretical results on the energy exchange between a swimming flexible two-dimensional hydrofoil of finite profile thickness and the inviscid incompressible fluid in which the body swims. The rate at which kinetic energy is transferred to the fluid by the undulating hydrofoil, the power required to maintain the prescribed motion, and the resulting power available for propulsion are calculated in terms of the thickness to chord ratio and the displacement and rate of displacement of the hydrofoil. With a small unsteady perturbation theory, the analysis is decomposed to show separately the effects of the circulatory and non-circulatory flows, both depending on the first-order terms of the unsteady perturbation velocity components. In addition, an analysis is presented showing the effect of the non-linear unsteady pressure distribution on the surface of the hydrofoil. Contrary to what might be expected, this latter effect is of the same order of magnitude for a thick rounded-nose profile as for the flat plate where the effect is concentrated at the sharp leading edge and is related to the so-called suction force. However, except for small values of the reduced frequency, the non-linear contribution is negligible in comparison with the linear contribution.New functions associated with the retarded flow in the wake are introduced and special techniques for their solution are presented, these being related to Theodorsen&apos;s function of unsteady airfoil theory for the special case of the undulating flat plate.The numerical results reveal that the kinetic energy imparted to the fluid, the power required to maintain the motion, and the resulting propulsive power, follow closely those of an infinitesimal model for small values of the reduced frequency of oscillation, but diverge somewhat from the classical thin plate analysis for large reduced frequencies. Of particular interest is the fact that a very large percentage of the power required to maintain the motion is used in the generation of the wake, whereas a very small percentage of the power available for propulsion comes from the wake. This indicates that, if some mechanism could be devised to control the wake, very high swimming efficiencies could be attained. Fish, in all probability, have been succeeding in doing this for millions of years. },

The subject of this paper is the flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a region containing immersed boundaries which move with the fluid and exert forces on the fluid. An example of such a boundary is the flexible leaflet of a human heart valve. It is the main achievement of the present paper that a method for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a rectangular domain can now be applied to a problem involving this type of immersed boundary. This is accomplished by replacing the boundary by a field of force which is defined on the mesh points of the rectangular domain and which is calculated from the configuration of the boundary. In order to link the representations of the boundary and fluid, since boundary points and mesh points need not coincide, a semi-discrete analog of the [delta] function is introduced. Because the boundary forces are of order h-1, and because they are sensitive to small changes in boundary configuration, they tend to produce numerical instability. This difficulty is overcome by an implicit method for calculating the boundary forces, a method which takes into account the displacements that will be produced by the boundary forces themselves. The numerical scheme is applied to the two-dimensional simulation of flow around the natural mitral valve.},

The flow pattern of blood in the heart is intimately connected with the performance of the heart valves. This paper extends previous work on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of moving immersed boundaries which interact with the fluid. The boundary representation now includes the muscular heart wall. The fixed topology of the boundary representation is exploited in the solution of the nonlinear equations which implicitly define the boundary forces. An improved numerical representation of the [delta]-function is introduced. A fast Laplace-solver is used. The results of calculations with a natural valve and with a prosthetic valve are presented.},

	abstract = {Detailed experimental results are presented for the initial impact force on a sphere striking a horizontal liquid surface vertically a t speeds in the range 1-3 m s-l. Results are discussed in terms of an impact drag coefficient. Liquids having viscosities in the range 10-3-102 Pa s have been studied. For low viscosities the results have been compared with the theoretical calculations of Shiffman & Spencer. Good agreement has been found in most respects; in particular the impact force varies as the square root of the depth for depths less than a tenth of the radius. The impact drag coefficient has also been studied through the transition from inertia to viscositydominated conditions. The variation of the impact drag coefficient is presented as a function of Reynolds number, and its variation in the range 5 x c Re < 5 x lo3 is shown to resemble that of a fully immersed sphere moving steadily in a homogeneous fluid.},

A simple, but powerful, method is described that is based on the concept of a fractional volume of fluid (VOF). This method is shown to be more flexible and efficient than other methods for treating complicated free boundary configurations. To illustrate the method, a description is given for an incompressible hydrodynamics code, SOLA-VOF, that uses the VOF technique to track free fluid surfaces.},

	abstract = {A mathematical model for the horizontal plane slow motions of ships connected to a mooring terminal through a single elastic line is developed based on the ship manoeuvring equations and a non-linear elastic mooring line model. Slowly varying excitations from current, wind and drift forces are included. Local perturbation analysis about the critical points of the corresponding autonomous system reveals the asymptotic stability characteristics of the mooring system. Time simulations using a tanker and a barge confirm the theoretically predicted long term behaviour and show the short term system behaviour. The mooring system may exhibit instability in sway, yaw and surge or reach a limit cyclic depending on the properties of the critical points, vessel type, propeller, initial conditions, current and wind. },

	abstract = {The horizontal plane motions --- surge, sway, yaw --- of a ship towed by two tug boats, or moored to two terminals, are modelled by the nonlinear third order maneuvering equations without memory. Nylon lines, chains, or steel cables are used as towing/mooring lines. Excitation consists of time independent current, wind an mean wave drift forces. The resulting Nonlinear Time Varying (NTV) model is studied by simulation, local linear, and global nonlinear stability analyses. Two-Line Towing/Mooring (TLT/M) systems exhibit, in general, three equilibria. Linear analysis reveals that equilibria may be attractor or repellor nodal or focus points. Near first equilibrium, it is shown that of the five Routh-Hurwitz criteria only two can be active in TLT/M systems of conventional ship hulls. Subsequent parametric study reveals the complexity of stability boundaries which may exhibit fold or cusp singularities. Global analysis is used to find attractor limit cycles and chaotic behavior. A barge with or without stabilizing skegs, a marinetype cargo ship, and a tanker with and without propeller which have different stability characteristics are used in nonlinear numerical simulations to verify all theoretical conclusions. },

	abstract = {A three-dimensional time domain approach is used to study the large-amplitude motions and loads of a ship in a seaway. In this approach, the exact body boundary condition is satisfied on the instantaneous wetted surface of the moving body while the free-surface boundary conditions are linearised. The problem is solved using a transient free-surface Green function source distribution on the submerged hull. Extensive results are presented which validate and demonstrate the efficacy of the method. These results include linear and large-amplitude motion coefficients and diffraction forces with and without forward speed, calm-water resistance and added-resistance with waves and motions, the large-amplitude motion history of a ship advancing in an irregular seaway, as well as load distributions on the changing submerged hull. Most of the large-amplitude results we obtained are new and illustrate the importance of nonlinear effects associated with the changing wetted hull. Of special significance are the dramatic changes of the added mass, the steady resistance, and sinkage and trim forces as the motion amplitudes increase.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT The three-dimensional waving plate theory is developed to investigate the swimming performance of fish undulatory motion. In particular, the propulsive effectiveness is discussed. The unsteady potential flow over model rectangular and triangular flexible plates performing a motion which consists of a progressing wave with variable amplitudes is calculated by the vortex ring panel method. It is found that the undulatory motion can reduce three-dimensional effects. It is this important hydrodynamic phenomenon that may be one of the main reasons why such undulation is widely used as the swimming method by a large number of aquatic animals. When the span of the undulating plate is nearly unchanged and the wave amplitude is constant or increases slightly along the chord, and the wavelength is close to the body length, theoretical results show that the swimming performance is best and the flow around the plate has a quasi-two-dimensional property. This swimming method may be observed in many fishes, especially those with an anguilliform mode of propulsion. The modification of the anguilliform mode of propulsion to the carangiform mode is also discussed. It is confirmed that the pronounced necking of the body anterior to the tail, which acts to improve the propulsive performance, is a major morphological adaptation of fishes using the carangiform mode, in which the characteristic nature of flexural movement confined to the rear part of the body is that the amplitude of undulation increases posteriorly and no complete wavelength is at any time apparent. },

	abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or 'colors,' are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

In this paper the applicability of artificial neural networks as pattern classifiers is investigated. To study the behaviour of neural networks as pattern classifier for complex data, the identification and counting of phytoplankton, based upon flow cytometer data, is taken as an example. For this problem most conventional pattern recognition techniques fail, due to the shape of the clusters in the data. Three experiments have been carried out. First, it is investigated whether artificial neural systems are capable of discriminating between two different classes of algal species (poisonous species and non-poisonous species). Second, it is tested whether neural network systems can be used for identification of algal species. Third, the robustness of neural network systems towards changes in the flow cytometer settings has been studied. The results of these experiments show that a neural network system may be used as a pattern classifier.},

	abstract = {A novel technique related to Peskin's immersed boundary approach is used to introduce solid surfaces into a simulated flow field. The Navier-Stokes equations permit the presence of an externally imposed body force that may vary in space and time. Forces are chosen to lie along a desired surface and to have a magnitude and direction opposing the local flow such that the flow is brought to rest on an element of the surface. For unsteady viscous flow the direct calculation of the needed force is facilitated by a feedback scheme in which the velocity is used to iteratively determine the desired value. In particular, we determine the surface body force from the relation f(x5, t ) = [alpha] [integral operator]t0 U(x5, t' ) dt' + [beta]U(x5, t) for surface points x5, velocity U, time t, and negative constants [alpha] and [beta]. Examples are presented which include 2D flow around cylinders, 3D turbulent channel flow where one boundary is simulated with a force field, and turbulent channel flow over a riblet-covered surface. While the new method may be applied to complex geometries on a non-Cartesian mesh, we have chosen to use a simple Cartesian grid. All simulations are done with a spectral code in a single computational domain without any mapping of the mesh.},

As a result, derivatives of the solution u may be discontinuous across \Gamma. We also allow the specification of a jump discontinuity in u itself across \Gamma.

@article{Carlson1995,
	abstract = {An algorithm has been developed which extends the scope of spectral methods to include solution of non-canonical channel flows arising from more complicated wall geometries. This significantly broadens the direct numerical simulation data base and its range of application, providing an accurate tool for the investigation of flows over three-dimensional surfaces which move in time. Through a time-dependent, curvilinear transformation a general domain is mapped to one which permits spectral representation of the solution and preserves exact boundary conditions. Beginning with the Navier-Stokes equation in general tensor form, application of a metric operator effects the transformation. The primitive variables are represented pseudospectrally (Fourier in the stream- and spanwise directions, Chebyshev wall-normal). Covariant differentiation generates variable coefficient terms in the equations for pressure and velocity, necessitating an iterative solution scheme. Standard benchmark tests validate flat-wall flow simulations. Static and dynamic tests of one-dimensional flow over a perturbed wall confirm the accuracy of the time-dependent transformation. Low Reynolds number simulations replicate the appropriate qualitative features of Stokes flow across two- and three-dimensional wall topographies. Results from a higher Reynolds number simulation of separated flow behind a three-dimensional Gaussian protuberance match well with an independent solution from Mason and Morton who have used a finite-difference method.},

@article{Goldstein1995,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT An immersed boundary technique is used to model a riblet covered surface on one wall of a channel bounding fully developed turbulent flow. The conjecture that the beneficial drag reduction effect of riblets is a result of the damping of cross-flow velocity fluctuations is then examined. This possibility has been discussed by others but is unverified. The damping effect is explicitly modelled by applying a cross-flow damping force field in elongated streamwise zones with a height and spacing corresponding to the riblet crests. The same trends are observed in the turbulence profiles above both riblet and damped surfaces, thus supporting cross-flow damping as a beneficial mechanism. It is found in the examples presented that the effect of the riblets on the mean flow field quantities (mean velocity profile, velocity fluctuations, Reynolds shear stress, and low&ndash;speed sreak spacing) is small. The riblests cause a relatively small drag reduction of about 4%, a figure that is in rough agreement with experiments and other computations. The simulations also suggest a mechanism for the observed displacement of the turbulence quantities away from the wall.The immersed boundary technique used to model the riblets consists of creating an externally imposed spatially localized body force which opposes the flow velocity and creates a riblet-like surface. For unstead viscous flow the calculation of the force is done with a feedback scheme in which the velocity is used to iteratively determine the desired value. In particular, the surface body force is determined by the relation f(xs, t) = &alpha; &int; t0 U(xs,t&prime;)dt&prime; + &beta;U(xs, t) for surface points xs, velocity U time t and negative constants &alpha; and &beta;. All simulations are done with a spectral code in a single computational domain without any mapping of the mesh. The combination of the immersed boundary and spectral techniques can potentially be used to solve other problems having complex geometry and flow physics. },

This approach readily allows the imposition of a no-slip boundary within the flow field by a feedback forcing term added to the momentum equations. In the present work, this technique is used with a high-order finite difference method, effectively eliminating spurious oscillations caused by the feedback forcing when used with spectrally discretized flow solvers. Very good agreement is found between the present calculations and previous computational and experimental results for steady and time-dependent flow at low Reynolds numbers.},

@article{Williamson1996,
	abstract = {{Since the review of periodic flow phenomena by Berger \& Wille (1972)
   in this journal, over twenty years ago, there has been a surge of
   activity regarding bluff body wakes. Many of the questions regarding
   wake vortex dynamics from the earlier review have now been answered in
   the literature, and perhaps an essential key to our new understandings
   (and indeed to new questions) has been the recent focus, over the past
   eight years, on the three-dimensional aspects of nominally
   two-dimensional wake hows. New techniques in experiment, using
   laser-induced fluorescence and PIV (Particle-Image-Velocimetry), are
   vigorously being applied to wakes, but interestingly, several of the
   new discoveries have come from careful use of classical methods. There
   is no question that strides forward in understanding of the wake
   problem are being made possible by ongoing three dimensional direct
   numerical simulations, as well, as by the surprisingly successful use
   of analytical modeling in these flows, and by secondary stability
   analyses. These new developments, and the discoveries of several new
   phenomena in wakes, are presented in this review.}},

A method for assessing the prediction quality of mechanistic forest growth models was presented. The method consists of four steps: assuming distributions for parameter values, parameter screening, outlining model behavior through sampling, and approximating model behavior based on the sampled points. The proposed method was then applied to a carbon balance stand level forest growth model. The Monte Carlo method was employed to perform the sampling, whereas the approximation was carried out with a [`]patterned' artificial neural network. A massively parallel computer was used for the sampling and approximating the model behavior with the neural network. It was found that the initial parameter variance did not cause significant bias in predictions, and the variances of the predictions were mainly contributed by only a few parameters. Such information allows us to analyze the contribution of different model components and provides a basis to improve the model.},

Following a comparison of current alternative approaches for modelling and prediction of algal blooms, artificial neural networks are introduced and applied as a new, promising model type. The neural network applications were developed and validated by limnological time-series from four different freshwater systems. The water-specific time-series comprised cell numbers or biomass of the ten dominating algae species as observed over up to twelve years and the measured environmental driving variables. The resulting predictions on succession, timing and magnitudes of algal species indicate that artificial neural networks can fit the complexity and nonlinearity of ecological phenomena apparently to a high degree.},

In recent times, an apparent increase in the frequency and intensity of blooms of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) in the River Murray (Australia) has caused widespread concern. When present in large numbers, they can cause serious problems for domestic, industrial, agricultural and recreational users of water, as they can produce toxins and impart undesirable tastes and odours to water. It is important to understand the relationship between the incidence of algal populations and the prevailing environmental conditions in order to prevent algal blooms from occurring. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to model the incidence of a specific genus of cyanobacteria (Anabaena sp.) in the River Murray at Morgan, with the dual objectives of forecasting algal concentrations to give prior warning of impending blooms and to identify the factors that affect the blooms of Anabaena. The model inputs include weekly values of turbidity, colour, temperature, flow and the concentrations of total nitrogen, as well as soluble and total phosphorus. The results obtained are very promising as the model was able to forecast most major variations in Anabaena concentrations (timing and magnitude) for an eight-year period two weeks in advance. A sensitivity analysis carried out on the model inputs indicated that all input variables are important, with no one variable being dominant.},

Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods can be used to automate the acquisition of ecological knowledge, i.e., automate the construction of ecological models. This paper describes a particular methodology of machine learning, called rule induction, and its application to data analysis in several ecological domains. These include the biological classification of British rivers based on bioindicator data, the analysis of the influence of physical and chemical parameters on selected bioindicator organisms in Slovenian rivers and the biological classification of Slovenian rivers based on physical and chemical parameters as well as bioindicator data. In all three cases, valuable models (knowledge) in the form of rules were extracted from data acquired through environmental monitoring and/or expert interpretation of the acquired samples. This provides positive evidence for the utility of machine learning in ecological modelling.},

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.},

	abstract = {A highly efficient numerical approach based on multigrid and preconditioning methods is developed for modeling 3D steady and time-dependent incompressible flows. The k-omega turbulence model is used to estimate the effects of turbulence. The model equations are solved together with the N-S equations in a strongly coupled way, and acceleration techniques like the multigrid method are also used for the turbulence model equations. For unsteady problems, a dual-time stepping procedure is adopted to satisfy the divergence-free constraint and to obtain a time-accurate solution. To improve the performance of this approach for small physical time steps, a modification to residual smoothing parameters is proposed. The numerical algorithm and the turbulence model are validated first by calculating unsteady inviscid flow around an oscillating cylinder, unsteady laminar flow past a circular cylinder, and steady high-Reynolds number turbulent flow over a 6:1, prolate spheroid. Then the three-dimensional time-dependent turbulent flow over a spheroid when it is undergoing a pitch-up maneuver is calculated and compared with experimental data.},

@article{Goldstein1998,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT The effects of riblets on one wall of a channel bounding fully developed turbulent flow are investigated. Various perturbation elements including wires, fins and slots are modelled in order to understand the effects of riblets. It is found that widely spaced riblets, fins and wires create a substantial increase in turbulent activity just above the element. These elements are also found to produce a remarkable pattern of secondary mean flows consisting of matched pairs of streamwise vortices. The secondary flows occur only if the bulk flow is turbulent and their characteristics depend on element geometry. It is suggested that these secondary flows are strongly linked with the increase in drag experienced by widely spaced riblets in experimental studies. The secondary flows are probably caused by two-dimensional spanwise sloshing of the flow, inherent in a turbulent boundary layer, interacting with the stream-aligned element. This two-dimensional mechanism is investigated with a series of two-dimensional simulations of sloshing flow over isolated elements. Grid resolution and domain size checks are made throughout the investigation. },

	abstract = {
The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modelling the incidence of cyanobacteria in rivers was investigated by forecasting the occurrence of a species group of Anabaena in the River Murray at Morgan, Australia. The networks of backpropagation type were trained on 7 years of weekly data for eight variables, and their ability to provide a 4-week forecast was evaluated for a 28-week period. They were relatively successful in providing a good forecast of both the incidence and magnitude of a growth peak of the cyanobacteria within the limits required for water quality monitoring. The use of lagged versus unlagged inputs was evaluated in the implementation and performance of the networks. Lagged inputs proved far superior in providing a fit to the actual data. Sensitivity analysis of input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the forecast values. The analysis indicated that for this data set for the River Murray, flow and temperature were the predominant variables in determining the onset and duration of cyanobacterial growth. Water colour was the next most important variable in determining the magnitude of the population growth peak. Plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and iron, and turbidity were less important for this time period.},

More particularly, attention is focused on obtaining an accurate description of the surface tension terms and the associated pressure jump. The stationary Laplace solution for a bubble with surface tension is considered. A careful treatment of the pressure gradient terms at the interface allows the reduction of the spurious currents to machine precision. Good results are obtained for the damped oscillations of a capillary wave compared with the initial-value linear theory. A classical test of Rayleigh-Taylor instability is presented.

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

Many existing methods such as generalized linear models and support vector machines are subsumed under this class. The flexibility of this class of techniques comes from the use of kernel functions as in support vector machines, and the generality from dual formulations of standard regression models. 1 Introduction Support vector machines [10] are linear maximum margin classifiers exploiting the idea of a kernel function. A kernel function defines an embedding of examples into (high or infinite dimensional) feature vectors and allows the classification to be carried out in the feature space without ever explicitly representing it. While support vector machines are non-probabilistic classifiers they can be extended and formalized for probabilistic settings[12] (recently also [8]), which is the topic of this paper. We can also identify the new formulations with other s...},

	abstract = {Building animation tools for fluid-like motions is an important and challenging problem with many applications in computer graphics. The use of physics-based models for fluid flow can greatly assist in creating such tools. Physical models, unlike key frame or procedural based techniques, permit an animator to almost effortlessly create interesting, swirling fluid-like behaviors. Also, the interaction of flows with objects and virtual forces is handled elegantly. Until recently, it was believed that physical fluid models were too expensive to allow real-time interaction. This was largely due to the fact that previous models used unstable schemes to solve the physical equations governing a fluid. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an unconditionally stable model which still produces complex fluid-like flows. As well, our method is very easy to implement. The stability of our model allows us to take larger time steps and therefore achieve faster simulations. We have used our model in conjuction with advecting solid textures to create many fluid-like animations interactively in two- and three-dimensions.},

	abstract = {
Mixture modelling is becoming an increasingly important tool in the remote sensing community as researchers attempt to resolve the sub-pixel, mixture information, which arises from the overlapping land cover types within the pixel's instantaneous field of view. This paper describes an approach based on a relatively new technique, support vector machines (SVMs), and contrasts this with more established algorithms such as linear spectral mixture models (LSMM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). In the simplest case, it is shown that the mixture regions formed by the linear support vector machine and the linear spectral mixture model are equivalent; however, the support vector machine automatically selects the relevant pure pixels. When non-linear algorithms are considered it can be shown that the non-linear support vector machines have model spaces which contain many of the conventional neural networks, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis functions. However, the non-linear support vector machines automatically determine the relevant set of basis functions (nodes) from the performance constraints specified via the loss function and in doing so select only the data points which are important for making a decision. In practice, it has been found that only about 5% of the training exemplars are used to form the decision boundary region, which represents a considerable compression of the data and also means that validation effort can be concentrated on just those important data points.},

In this article, a measure of model complexity known as the VC dimension is presented and some mathematical theory surrounding the derivation and use of this metric is summarized. The metric allows in some instances, for a modeller to control the amount of error that is returned from a modelling system. Moreover, it allows modellers to state upper bounds on the amount of error that the modelling system will return on all future, as yet unseen and uncollected datasets. Some computational experiments utilizing this theory in a series of models predicting the spatial distribution of plant species on the east coast of Australia are presented and their results are discussed.},

Momentum balance is computed using explicit finite volume/finite differences on a regular cubic grid. Surface tension is implemented by the continuous surface stress or continuous surface force method. Examples and verifications of the method are given by comparing simulations to analytical results and experiments, for sedimenting droplet arrays and capillary waves at finite Reynolds number. In the case of a pinching pendant drop, both three-dimensional and axisymmetric simulations are compared to experiments. Agreement is found both before and after the reconnections.},

	abstract = {Interfaces have a variety of boundary conditions (or jump conditions) that need to be enforced. The Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) was developed to capture the boundary conditions at a contact discontinuity in the inviscid Euler equations and has been extended to treat more general discontinuities such as shocks, detonations, and deflagrations and compressible viscous flows. In this paper, a similar boundary condition capturing approach is used to develop a new numerical method for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the presence of interfaces where both the variable coefficients and the solution itself may be discontinuous. This new method is robust and easy to implement even in three spatial dimensions. Furthermore, the coefficient matrix of the associated linear system is the standard symmetric matrix for the variable coefficient Poisson equation in the absence of interfaces allowing for straightforward application of standard #black##box# solvers.},

@article{Fadlun2000,
	abstract = {A second-order accurate, highly efficient method is developed for simulating unsteady three-dimensional incompressible flows in complex geometries. This is achieved by using boundary body forces that allow the imposition of the boundary conditions on a given surface not coinciding with the computational grid. The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several flows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex flow with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model.},

	abstract = {The generation of ship bow waves is studied within the framework of potential flow theory. Assuming the ship bow to be slender, or thin, a pattern of the flow is derived using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. This method leads to the determination of three dierent zones in which three asymptotic expansions are performed and matched. To rst order with respect to the slenderness parameter, the near-eld flow appears to be two-dimensional in each transverse plane along the bow. However, it is demonstrated that three-dimensional eects are important in front of the ship and must be taken into account in the composite solution. This leads to a three-dimensional correction to be added to the two-dimensional solution along the ship. The asymptotic approach is then applied to explain the structure of the bow flow in connection with experimental observations and numerical simulations.},

In order to summarise the structure of ecological communities some ordination techniques are well known and widely-used, (e.g. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Correspondence Analysis (CoA). Inspired by the structure and the mechanism of the human brain, the Artificial Neural Networks should be a convenient alternative tool to traditional statistical methods. The Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is one of the most well-known neural network with unsupervised learning rules; it performs a topology-preserving projection of the data space onto a regular two-dimensional space. Its achievement has already been demonstrated in various areas, but this approach is not yet widely known and used by ecologists. The present work describes how SOM can be used for the study of ecological communities. After the presentation of SOM adapted to ecological data, SOM was trained on popular example data; upland forest in Wisconsin (USA). The SOM results were compared with classical statistical techniques. Similarity between the results may be observed and constitutes a validation of the SOM method. SOM algorithm seems fully usable in ecology, it can perfectly complete classical techniques for exploring data and for achieving community ordination.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new volume of fluid (VOF) advection algorithm, termed the defined donating region (DDR) scheme. The algorithm uses a linear piecewise method of free surface reconstruction, coupled to a fully multi-dimensional method of cell boundary flux integration. The performance of the new scheme has been compared with the performance of a number of alternative schemes using translation, rotation and shear advection tests. The DDR scheme is shown to be generally more accurate than linear constant and flux limited schemes, and comparable with an alternative linear piecewise scheme. The DDR scheme conserves fluid volume rigorously without local redistribution algorithms, and generates no fluid flotsam or other debris, making it ideal in applications where stability of the free surface interface is paramount.

	abstract = {A new immersed-boundary method for simulating flows over or inside complex geometries is developed by introducing a mass source/sink as well as a momentum forcing. The present method is based on a finite-volume approach on a staggered mesh together with a fractional-step method. Both momentum forcing and mass source are applied on the body surface or inside the body to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition on the immersed boundary and also to satisfy the continuity for the cell containing the immersed boundary. In the immersed-boundary method, the choice of an accurate interpolation scheme satisfying the no-slip condition on the immersed boundary is important because the grid lines generally do not coincide with the immersed boundary. Therefore, a stable second-order interpolation scheme for evaluating the momentum forcing on the body surface or inside the body is proposed. Three different flow problems (decaying vortices and flows over a cylinder and a sphere) are simulated using the immersed-boundary method proposed in this study and the results agree very well with previous numerical and experimental results, verifying the accuracy of the present method.},

Genetic algorithms proved to be very innovative for hybridizing deductive models, and evolving predictive rules, process equations and parameters.

Concern for environmental issues has increased in recent years. Waste production influences humanity's future. The alga, an ubiquitous single-celled plant, can thrive on industrial waste, to the detriment of water clarity and human activities. To avoid this, biologists need to isolate the chemical parameters of these rapid population fluctuations. This paper proposes a Fuzzy-Rough Estimator of Algae Populations (FuREAP), a hybrid system involving Fuzzy Set and Rough Set theories that estimates the size of algae populations given certain water characteristics. Through dimensionality reduction, FuREAP significantly reduces computer time and space requirements. Also, it decreases the cost of obtaining measurements and increases runtime efficiency, making the system more viable economically. By retaining only information required for the estimation task, FuREAP offers higher accuracy than conventional rule induction systems. Finally, FuREAP does not alter the domain semantics, making the distilled knowledge human-readable. The paper addresses the problem domain, architecture and modus operandi of FuREAP, and provides and discusses detailed experimental results.},

Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm are a useful tool for modelling environmental systems. They have already been successfully used to model salinity, nutrient concentrations, air pollution, and algal growth. These successes, coupled with their suitability for modelling complex systems, have resulted in an increase in their popularity and their application in an ever increasing number of areas. They are generally treated as black box models that are able to capture underlying relationships when presented with input and output data. In many instances, little consideration is given to potential input data and the internal workings of ANNs. This can result in inferior model performance and an inability to accurately compare the performance of different ANN models. Back-propagation networks employ a modelling philosophy that is similar to that of statistical methods in the sense that unknown model parameters (i.e., connection weights) are adjusted in order to obtain the best match between a historical set of model inputs and corresponding outputs. Consequently, the principles that are considered good practice in the development of statistical models should be considered. In this paper, a systematic approach to the development of ANN based forecasting models is presented, which is intended to act as a guide for potential and current users of feedforward ANNs that are trained with the back-propagation algorithm.

	abstract = {
A new approach to neural network models is able to overcome the black-box-problem of neural networks by producing a measure, how sure the network is about its answer. The principle idea behind this measure is to use a two-segmented network, where the first segment works as an input-oriented, (mostly trained by unsupervised methods) classification device, whereas the second segment produces the output based on the classification given by the first segment. An analysis how good an input fits into the given classification produces the measure for the quality of the network response. This measure is of course by no means of the quality of error bars produced by statistical methods, however it is a good indication of how close the given input is to those used for the training of the neural network. Neural network models with this two-segmented architecture are not new, (e.g. RBFN or counterpropagation networks), however they have not been used so far to obtain information about possible errors of the network. We apply this network to data on bioindication and niche identification of 10 small rivers in German low-mountains and a long-term study of a small stream in Schleiter et al., (this journal) and Obach et al., (this journal) and compare the results to different approaches. Conclusion: The new network approach is suitable for creating models that are capable to estimate the accuracy of their response even in the situation where only few data for training are available.},

Drag reductions of about 25% and suppression of vortex shedding have been recorded for the cylinder with bumps. VIV experiments over a range of the mass damping parameter from 2×10−2to 5 have shown that amplitudes of oscillation for the wavy body and the cylinder with bumps still develop at low values of mass damping, even though shedding cannot be detected from the bodies when they are fixed. VIV can be suppressed at significantly lower values of mass-damping than required to stabilize a circular cylinder.},

Two modelling paradigms were applied to the prediction of phytoplankton abundance in the Burrinjuck Reservoir: the deductive model SALMO and the inductive model ANNA. While SALMO is driven by process-based differential equations, the model ANNA is designed as recurrent feedforward neural network trained by time series data. Predictions of chlorophyll-a for the years 1979-1982 by both models were validated by means of measured data. Results showed that SALMO is able to predict annual average trends not only of chlorophyll-a but other chemical and biological state variables as well. It supports decision making by evaluating alternative scenarios for strategic eutrophication control. The model ANNA achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting timing and magnitudes of algal biomass up to 7 days ahead. The recurrent feedforward architecture of ANNA proved to be most efficient in order to model and predict seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its forecasting results can be utilized for early warning and tactical control of algal blooms in freshwater lakes. A sensitivity analysis conducted by ANNA revealed that algal abundance in Burrinjuck Reservoir is not only driven by physical and chemical characteristics of the water body but to a large extend by hydrological characteristics such as water depth as well.},

	abstract = {
Biological identification poses many problems which are not commonly met in other areas where artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied. One such problem is that the number of possible classes is often unbounded and it is necessary to be able to deal with novel categories (taxa) either by rejecting them or retraining to allow for them. Where it is necessary to incorporate them, retraining a neural network may be time consuming and or impossible. One way of negating this problem is to use single-category networks that can be combined and configured as required.
This paper compares support vector machines (SVMs) with strongly partitioned traditional radial basis function (RBF) networks for the discrimination of single species of phytoplankton against a background of N other species. SVMs resulted in greater identification success than the unpartitioned, large single RBF networks (81 and 77%, respectively), though partitioned RBF ANNs performed relatively poorly (50% success) at discrimination of 61 marine phytoplankton species from flow cytometry data. Greatest success was achieved by combining the outputs of the individual networks by means of a [`]winner takes all' strategy; with RBF ANNs identification success dramatically increased (from 16 to 50%), though there was only a modest increase with SVMs (77-81%). When SVMs trained on one data set were tested with data on cells grown under different light conditions, an overall successful identification was low (13%), but when SVMs were trained on a combined data set identification was high (>70%). Clearly, it is essential to cover the whole spectrum of biological variation in the training data set.},

	abstract = {
The paper describes a novel pattern recognition system (MIR-max) that was developed to facilitate the construction of a river pollution diagnostic system for the British Environment Agency. MIR-max is a non-neural self-organising map based on information theory, which, unlike Kohonen's Self-organised map (SOM), separates the processes of clustering and ordering. It first clusters the input samples into a pre-defined number of classes by maximising the mutual information between the samples and the classes. The classes are then ordered in a two-dimensional output space by maximising the correlation coefficient (r) between the Euclidean distances separating the classes in data space and their corresponding distances in output space. This produces a map of the classes which when labelled can be used for the classification/diagnosis of new samples. A novel feature of MIR-max is that it permits the disaggregation of the classes in the output map, thus permitting exceptional classes to separate from their neighbours. MIR-max is designed specifically for use with ordinal data, but can also be used for interval-valued data. Its application in the ecological field is demonstrated via two examples based on data from the 1995 river quality survey of England and Wales. In the first example, MIR-max is used to classify biological samples into 100 river quality classes for each of five site types. These classifiers are then tested against two corresponding neural network classifiers, and are shown to provide better performance. In the second example, MIR-max is used to classify combined biological and environmental (i.e. physical characteristics of the site) data directly into 500 quality classes. The way in which this pattern classifier has been used to produce a river pollution diagnostic system is then explained. The advantages of the system over traditional river quality assessment systems, like RIVPACS, are outlined. It is concluded that MIR-max has considerable potential for use in the visualisation and interpretation of multivariate ecological data.},

A model to quantify the interactions between abiotic factors and algal genera in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan was developed using artificial neural network technology. Results showed that the timing and magnitude of algal blooms of Microcystis, Phormidium and Synedra in Lake Kasumigaura could be successfully predicted. As for the newly occurring dominant Oscillatoria, results were not satisfactory. The evaluation of the importance of factors showed that Microcystis, Phormidium, Oscillatoria and Synedra were alkalophilic. The algal proliferation for Microcystis, Oscillatoria and Synedra decrease due to the increase in total nitrogen, while the growth of Phormidium is enhanced with more nitrogen. In addition, the algal density is affected by zooplankton grazing but with the exception of Phormidium due to it being poor food source. Algal responses to the orthogonal combinations of the external environmental factors, chemical oxygen demand, pH, total nitrogen and total phosphorus at three levels were modeled. Various combinations of environmental factors enhance the proliferation of some algae while other combinations inhibit bloom formation.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the variable coefficient Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on an irregular domain and show that one can obtain second-order accuracy with a rather simple discretization. Moreover, since our discretization matrix is symmetric, it can be inverted rather quickly as opposed to the more complicated nonsymmetric discretization matrices found in other second-order-accurate discretizations of this problem. Multidimensional computational results are presented to demonstrate the second-order accuracy of this numerical method. In addition, we use our approach to formulate a second-order-accurate symmetric implicit time discretization of the heat equation on irregular domains. Then we briefly consider Stefan problems.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the mathematical structure of the immersed boundary (IB) method, which is intended for the computer simulation of fluid-structure interaction, especially in biological fluid dynamics. The IB formulation of such problems, derived here from the principle of least ac- tion, involves both Eulerian and Lagrangian variables, linked by the Dirac delta function. Spatial discretization of the IB equations is based on a fixed Cartesian mesh for the Eulerian variables, and a moving curvilinear mesh for the Lagrangian variables. The two types of variables are linked by interaction equations that involve a smoothed approximation to the Dirac delta function. Eulerian/Lagrangian identities govern the transfer of data from one mesh to the other. Temporal discretization is by a second-order Runge-Kutta method. Current and future research directions are pointed out, and applications of the IB method are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT We employ a three-dimensional, nonlinear inviscid numerical method, in conjunction with experimental data from live fish and from a fish-like robotic mechanism, to establish the three-dimensional features of the flow around a fish-like body swimming in a straight line, and to identify the principal mechanisms of vorticity control employed in fish-like swimming. The computations contain no structural model for the fish and hence no recoil correction. First, we show the near-body flow structure produced by the travelling-wave undulations of the bodies of a tuna and a giant danio. As revealed in cross-sectional planes, for tuna the flow contains dominant features resembling the flow around a two-dimensional oscillating plate over most of the length of the fish body. For the giant danio, on the other hand, a mixed longitudinal&ndash;transverse structure appears along the hind part of the body. We also investigate the interaction of the body-generated vortices with the oscillating caudal fin and with tail-generated vorticity. Two distinct vorticity interaction modes are identified: the first mode results in high thrust and is generated by constructive pairing of body-generated vorticity with same-sign tail-generated vorticity, resulting in the formation of a strong thrust wake; the second corresponds to high propulsive efficiency and is generated by destructive pairing of body-generated vorticity with opposite-sign tail-generated vorticity, resulting in the formation of a weak thrust wake. },

In the proposed method an arbitrary three-dimensional solid surface immersed in the fluid is discretized using an unstructured, triangular mesh, and all the Cartesian grid nodes near the interface are identified. Then, the solution at these nodes is reconstructed via linear interpolation along the local normal to the body, in a way that the desired boundary conditions for both pressure and velocity fields are enforced. The overall accuracy of the resulting solver is second-order, as it is demonstrated in two test cases involving laminar flow past a sphere.},

An efficient ghost-cell immersed boundary method (GCIBM) for simulating turbulent flows in complex geometries is presented. A boundary condition is enforced through a ghost cell method. The reconstruction procedure allows systematic development of numerical schemes for treating the immersed boundary while preserving the overall second-order accuracy of the base solver. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions can be treated. The current ghost cell treatment is both suitable for staggered and non-staggered Cartesian grids. The accuracy of the current method is validated using flow past a circular cylinder and large eddy simulation of turbulent flow over a wavy surface. Numerical results are compared with experimental data and boundary-fitted grid results. The method is further extended to an existing ocean model (MITGCM) to simulate geophysical flow over a three-dimensional bump. The method is easily implemented as evidenced by our use of several existing codes.},

	abstract = {
An artificial neural network (ANN), a data driven modelling approach, is proposed to predict the algal bloom dynamics of the coastal waters of Hong Kong. The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamma Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that [`]future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamma is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.},

	abstract = {
Convinced by the predictive quality of artificial neural network (ANN) models in ecology, we have turned our interests to their explanatory capacities. Seven methods which can give the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input factors were compared: (i) the [`]PaD' (for Partial Derivatives) method consists in a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output according to the input variables; (ii) the [`]Weights' method is a computation using the connection weights; (iii) the [`]Perturb' method corresponds to a perturbation of the input variables; (iv) the [`]Profile' method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed value; (v) the [`]classical stepwise' method is an observation of the change in the error value when an adding (forward) or an elimination (backward) step of the input variables is operated; (vi) [`]Improved stepwise a' uses the same principle as the classical stepwise, but the elimination of the input occurs when the network is trained, the connection weights corresponding to the input variable studied is also eliminated; (vii) [`]Improved stepwise b' involves the network being trained and fixed step by step, one input variable at its mean value to note the consequences on the error. The data tested in this study concerns the prediction of the density of brown trout spawning redds using habitat characteristics. The PaD method was found to be the most useful as it gave the most complete results, followed by the Profile method that gave the contribution profile of the input variables. The Perturb method allowed a good classification of the input parameters as well as the Weights method that has been simplified but these two methods lack stability. Next came the two improved stepwise methods (a and b) that both gave exactly the same result but the contributions were not sufficiently expressed. Finally, the classical stepwise methods gave the poorest results.},

Their performance is tested for several standard shapes and is compared to a few other VOF/PLIC reconstruction techniques, showing in general a better convergence rate. The geometric nature of Lagrangian and Eulerian split advection algorithms is investigated in detail and a new mixed split Eulerian implicit-Lagrangian explicit (EI-LE) scheme is presented. This method conserves the mass to machine error, performs better than split Eulerian and Lagrangian algorithms, and it is only slightly worse than unsplit schemes. However, the combination of the interface reconstruction with the least-square fit and its advection with the EI-LE scheme appears superior to other existing approaches},

Conventional Eulerian computational methods are discussed and then contrasted with vorticity confinement, which is also Eulerian. The basic assumptions in vorticity confinement, are reviewed, and then the method itself is briefly outlined. Following the description, representative results are presented: First, two-dimensional results for convecting vortices and Cauchy-Riemann How over a cylinder are presented. These describe, respectively, the salient features of the method for convecting vortices and for flow over solid surfaces, embedded in a uniform Cartesian grid. Then, three-dimensional results for flow over complex configurations, including a complete rotorcraft, are presented.}},

@article{Loerstad2004,
	abstract = {An improved Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is presented which is applicable to high density ratio 3D flows for a large range of bubble Reynolds number (Re). The method is based on the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible multi-phase flows which are discretized on a Cartesian staggered grid. The multi-grid technique together with the pressure-velocity coupling scheme for multi-phase flows have resulted in an efficient solver which nearly exponentially converge with the number of iterations. The convergence speed also shows negligible dependence on density ratio, viscosity ratio and Re. A second-order accurate, non-diffusive, mass conservative phase transport model is presented which does not suffer from unphysical over- or under-shoots of the phase variable. The high accurate normal, curvature and surface tension force model in combination with the high-order defect-correction scheme for multi-phase flows shows second-order global accuracy when applied to the transient bubble rise where the viscosity ratio is equal to one. In contrast, the commonly used viscosity model for VOF introduces a first order error for the same problem. The VOF method has been tested for different types of bubble flows at low Re and for path-oscillating and wobbling air bubbles (in water) with a diameter range of 1.82<D<6 mm. The numerical results agree quantitatively with the available experimental data. The investigations show that the proposed high accurate surface tension model can be used successfully for wobbling flows with bubble deformation while maintaining the mass of the phases. The error in mass conservation is directly proportional to the residual in solving the discrete problem.},

   vortex-induced vibration (VIV), that have been made over the last two

   were hitherto not available. We bring together new concepts and
   phenomena generic to VIV systems, and pay special attention to the
   vortex dynamics and energy transfer that give rise to modes of
   vibration, the importance of mass and damping, the concept of a
   critical mass, the relationship between force and vorticity, and the
   concept of ``effective elasticity,{''} among other points. We present
   new vortex wake modes, generally in the framework of a map of vortex
   modes compiled from forced vibration studies, some of which cause free
   vibration. Some discussion focuses on topics of current debate, such as
   the decomposition of force, the relevance of the paradigm flow of an
   elastically mounted cylinder to more complex systems, and the
   relationship between forced and free vibration.}},

A method for analyzing carotenoid content in Haematococcus pluvialis, a green alga was developed using digital image processing (DIP) and an artificial neural network (ANN) model. About 90 images of algal cells in various phases of growth were processed with the tools of DIP. A good correlation of R2 = 0.967 was observed between carotenoid content as estimated by analytical method and DIP. Similar correlation was also observed in case of chlorophyll. Since the conventional methods of carotenoid estimation are time consuming and result in loss of pigments during analysis, DIP method was found to be an effective online monitoring method. This method will be useful in measurement of pigments in cultured cells.},

	abstract = {It is fascinating to think that the ideas of two 19th century naval architects could offer useful insights for 21st century scientists contemplating the exploration of our planetary system or monitoring the long-term effects of a neurosurgical procedure on gait. The Froude number, defined as Fr=v2/gL, where v is velocity, g is gravitational acceleration and L is a characteristic linear dimension (such as leg length), has found widespread application in the biomechanics of bipedal locomotion. This review of two parameters, Fr and dimensionless velocity {\^I}²=(Fr)1/2, that have served as the criterion for dynamic similarity, has been arranged in two parts: (I) historical development, including the contributions by William Froude and his son Edmund, two ship designers who lived more than 130 years ago, the classic insights of D{\^a}€{\texttrademark}Arcy Wentworth Thompson who, in his magnum opus On Growth and Form, espoused the connection between mathematics and biology, and the pioneering efforts of Robert McNeill Alexander, who popularised the application of Fr to animal locomotion; and (II) selected applications, including a comparison of walking for people of different heights, exploring the effects of different gravitational fields on human locomotion, establishing the impact of pathology and the benefits of treatment, and understanding the walking patterns of bipedal robots. Although not all applications of Fr to locomotion have been covered, the review offers an important historical context for all researchers of bipedal gait, and extends the idea of dimensionless scaling of gait parameters.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a novel wall-function formulation applicable to any RANS turbulence model. It is based on the assumption of wall layer universality, applied to the entire model. The approach is implemented via tables for the turbulence quantities and the friction velocity u[tau]. The influence of numerical errors on the wall-function solution is investigated and improvements are proposed. Numerical results are presented for a flat plate boundary layer at zero pressure gradient and for a flow with pressure gradient driven separation. The behavior of RANS turbulence models in the near wall region is also analyzed. The models considered are: Spalart-Allmaras, k-[omega], k-g and v2-f. The analysis of the v2-f model resulted in new analytical solutions in the viscous sublayer and logarithmic layer. The analytical solutions for the Spalart-Allmaras model can be used directly as a simple wall function.},

	abstract = {A new simulation based design (SBD) tool has been developed based on recursive neural network (RNN) technologies. This approach permits simulation based design to be performed in a real-time nonlinear simulation (RNS) environment. Further, this approach enables the fusion of experimental data, when available, with steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions. Building upon the extensive work done using RNNs to support Navy submarine simulation and control, a second-generation RNN simulation code has been developed to support submarine simulation based design. Previously, the 1st generation RNN maneuvering simulation tools were used for the prediction of blind submarine maneuvers in the ONR sponsored Maneuvering Simulation Challenge. A blind maneuver was one for which only the initial conditions and the controls directing the vehicle were provided to the participants. Inputs to the simulation were the controls acting on the vehicle such as propeller rotation speed, rudder and sternplane deflection time histories and the initial conditions. The outputs were time histories of the submarine state variables, the three linear and three angular velocity components. These output data were integrated to recover trajectory and attitude, and differentiated to determine the accelerations acting on the vehicle. Overall, the RNN simulations performed better than any of the other simulation tools including other empirical methods, potential codes and/or vortex tracking methods and unsteady RANS simulations. The focus of this paper is on the extension of these RNN based approaches for use as geometry-to-motion simulation tools. Specifically, a parent training data set for a particular vehicle is used to train an RNN to model how input forces and moments lead to particular output motions. Design changes to the vehicle can then be implemented by changing the input force and moment database. Appendages can be changed directly by specifying a new geometry and/or lift coefficient. The hull geometry can be modified either through the use of other empirical data and/or through the use of steady RANS solutions. The new force and moment database and the new geometry are then used as the input into the RNS based design code to determine the design change impact on vehicle maneuvering. Since only the input force and moment database is changed, no re-training of the RNN is required. As such, the new design simulation can be made in real-time, and the design cycle can, in theory, be shortened significantly. To date, this approach has been used to successfully demonstrate the maneuvering impact of design changes on the ONR Body 1 submarine appendages (sternplane and rudder). This approach resolves the main limitation in RNN technology, namely that it was difficult or impossible to design vehicles using this technology. Now, RNNs can not only be used for vehicle design, but the result of the design changes may be determined in real-time.},

In the central California coastal forests, a newly discovered virulent pathogen (Phytophthora ramorum) has killed hundreds of thousands of native oak trees. Predicting the potential distribution of the disease in California remains an urgent demand of regulators and scientists. Most methods used to map potential ranges of species (e.g. multivariate or logistic regression) require both presence and absence data, the latter of which are not always feasibly collected, and thus the methods often require the generation of [`]pseudo' absence data. Other methods (e.g. BIOCLIM and DOMAIN) seek to model the presence-only data directly. In this study, we present alternative methods to conventional approaches to modeling by developing support vector machines (SVMs), which are the new generation of machine learning algorithms used to find optimal separability between classes within datasets, to predict the potential distribution of Sudden Oak Death in California. We compared the performances of two types of SVMs models: two-class SVMs with [`]pseudo' absence data and one-class SVMs. Both models performed well. The one-class SVMs have a slightly better true-positive rate (0.9272 $\pm$ 0.0460 S.D.) than the two-class SVMs (0.9105 $\pm$ 0.0712 S.D.). However, the area predicted to be at risk for the disease using the one-class SVMs (18,441 km2) is much larger than that of the two-class SVMs (13,828 km2). Both models show that the majority of disease risk will occur in coastal areas. Compared with the results of two-class SVMs, the one-class SVMs predict a potential risk in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges; much greater risks are also found in Los Angles and Humboldt Counties. We believe the support vector machines when coupled with geographic information system (GIS) will be a useful method to deal with presence-only data in ecological analysis over a range of scales.},

The simulations are performed with CFDSHIP-IOWA, which is a general-purpose, multiblock, high-performance parallel computing RAINS code. Numerical verification studies in space and time demonstrate convergence for nearly all variables. The modified Wigley hull form experimental data presented in Journee (1992) are compared with simulation results over a range of Froude numbers, wavelengths, and wave amplitudes and found to give accurate results, with uncertainties less than 2\%. Viscous ship motions characteristics are investigated by decomposing the full nonlinear problem into the forward speed diffraction and pitch and heave radiation problems, in the manner of strip theory. Comparisons between the current viscous RAINS solutions and those from experiments, strip theory, and nonlinear potential flow simulations show the RANS method to predict damping and added mass coefficients with a high degree of accuracy.},

A new type of environmental numerical models, hybrid environmental numerical models (HEMs) based on combining deterministic modeling and machine learning components, is introduced and formulated. Conceptual and practical possibilities of developing HEM, as an optimal synergetic combination of the traditional deterministic/first principles modeling (like that used for solving PDEs on the sphere representing model dynamics of global climate models) and machine learning components (like accurate and fast neural network emulations of model physics or chemistry processes), are discussed. Examples of developed HEMs (hybrid climate models and a hybrid wind-wave ocean model) illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of the new approach for modeling extremely complex multidimensional systems.},

@article{Nourgaliev2006,
	abstract = {This paper presents an evolutionary step in sharp capturing of shocked, high acoustic impedance mismatch (AIM) interfaces in an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) environment. The central theme which guides the present development addresses the need to optimize between the algorithmic complexities in advanced front capturing and front tracking methods developed recently for high AIM interfaces with the simplicity requirements imposed by the AMR multi-level dynamic solutions implementation. The paper shows that we have achieved this objective by means of relaxing the strict conservative treatment of AMR prolongation/restriction operators in the interfacial region and by using a natural-neighbor-interpolation (NNI) algorithm to eliminate the need for ghost cell extrapolation into the other fluid in a characteristics-based matching (CBM) scheme. The later is based on a two-fluid Riemann solver, which brings the accuracy and robustness of front-tracking approach into the fast local level set front-capturing implementation of the CBM method. A broad set of test problems (including shocked multi-gaseous media, bubble collapse, underwater explosion and shock passing over a liquid drop suspended in a gaseous medium) was performed and the results demonstrate that the fundamental assumptions/approximations made in modifying the AMR prolongation/restriction operators and in using the NNI algorithm for interfacial treatment are acceptable from the accuracy point of view, while they enable an effective implementation and utility of the structured AMR technology for solving complex multiphase problems in a highly compressible setting.},

	abstract = {A non-boundary-conforming formulation for simulating complex turbulent flows with dynamically moving boundaries on fixed Cartesian grids is proposed. The underlying finite-difference solver for the filtered incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is based on a second-order fractional step method on a staggered grid. To satisfy the boundary conditions on an arbitrary immersed interface, the velocity field at the grid points near the interface is reconstructed using momentum forcing without smearing the sharp interface. The concept of field-extension is also introduced to treat the points emerging from a moving solid body to the fluid. Laminar flow cases and large-eddy simulations (LES) are presented to demonstrate the formal accuracy and range of applicability of the method. In particular, simulations of laminar flow induced by the harmonic in-line oscillation of a circular cylinder in quiescent fluid, and from a transversely oscillating cylinder in a free-stream are presented and compared to reference simulations and experiments. LES of turbulent flow over a traveling wavy wall and transitional flow through a bileaflet prosthetic heart valve are also shown. All results are in very good agreement with reference results in the literature.},

	abstract = {
For the first time, several models have been used to aid in the understanding of the bloom dynamics of Pyrodinium bahamense var. compressum, the major causal organism of toxic algal blooms in Manila Bay and several areas in the tropical world. The complex life cycle of Pyrodinium includes the formation of cysts that settle at the sediments, which can serve as the inoculum for the next bloom.
The seasonal variation of temperature and salinity reflects the combined effects of convection and water column stability, which can control vertical movement of plankton and other parameters essential to its growth. The significance of wind forcing appears to be related to the potential to resuspend cysts. In the absence of wind, tidal currents in the inner part of the bay may be too weak to induce resuspension. The addition of wind results in a significant increase in bottom current velocity. Off Cavite at the southeast, bottom velocity is enhanced by orbital motion due to waves, one of the reasons why sediments off this area are dominated by sandy material. The strong vertical mixing of the water column at depths of less than 10 m may influence nutrient and consequently, plankton populations.
The wave field during the southwest monsoon indicates that its contribution to the bottom velocity dominates in this area of the bay.
Bloom simulations using combined bio-physical parameters show that direction of advection is almost always along wind direction. The dispersal distances increases if the Pyrodinium cells are found higher in the water column. For cells originating from southeastern (Cavite) sources, the direction of transport is slightly towards the north. In either case, the formation of cysts after a bloom is adjacent to the northern area (Pampanga) for blooms originating from the western side (Bataan) and along the eastern side (Para{\~n}aque-Manila) for blooms originating from the southeastern side (Cavite). Comparison with a few records of bloom occurrences in Manila Bay shows some consistent features. Reports of these blooms also showed that they occurred almost always during spring tides. There appears to be two main systems for bloom formation: one fed by cyst beds in the west (Bataan) which is advected along the west-northwest coast (Bataan-Bulacan) while the other one is fed by the southeast (Cavite) cyst beds that dominates in the east-southeast (Para{\~n}aque-Cavite) area.},

	abstract = {For the simulation of flow around an arbitrarily moving body, an immersed boundary method is developed in a non-inertial reference frame that is fixed to the body. The Navier-Stokes equation is formulated in a conservative form such that the force terms due to the rotation and the translational and rotational accelerations are included in the nonlinear term. In order to satisfy the no-slip condition on the body surface, momentum forcing and mass source/sink are applied on the body surface or inside the body. The numerical method is based on a finite volume approach on a staggered mesh together with a fractional-step method. The present numerical method is applied to both the forced motion and fluid-structure interaction problems. In the latter, we solve fully coupled Navier-Stokes and dynamic equations for the moving body without introducing any iteration. Four different flow problems are tested and the results are in excellent agreements with previous numerical and experimental ones.},

Four learning techniques - decision trees/rules, neural networks, support vector machines and genetic programming - were applied to the problem. Support vector and neural network approaches gave marginally better predictivity, but in the context of low overall accuracy, decision trees and genetic programming gave more useful results because of the human comprehensibility of their models.},

We evaluate the use of artificial neural networks, particularly the feedforward multilayer perceptron with back-propagation for training (MLP), in ecological modelling and make suggestions on its use. In MLP modelling, there are no assumptions about the underlying form of the data that must be met as in standard statistical techniques. Instead, researchers must clarify the process of modelling, as this is most critical to how the model performs and is interpreted. Overfitting on the data, a potential problem, can be avoided by limiting the complexity of the model and by using techniques such as weight decay, training with noise, and limiting the training of the network. Methods on when to stop training include: (1) early stopping based on cross-validation, (2) stopping after a analyst defined error is reached or after the error levels off, and (3) use of a test data set. The third method is not ideal as the test data set is then not independent of model development and the resulting model may have little generalizability. The importance of an independent data set cannot be overemphasized as we found dramatic differences in model accuracy assessed with prediction accuracy on the training data set, as estimated with bootstrapping, and from use of an independent data set. The comparison of the artificial neural network with a general linear model (GLM) as a standard procedure is recommended because a GLM may perform as well or better than the MLP. In such cases, there are no interactions or non-linear terms that need to be modelled and it will save time to use the GLM. Techniques such as sensitivity analyses, input variable relevances, neural interpretation diagrams, randomization tests, and partial derivatives should be used to make MLP models more transparent, and further our ecological understanding, an important goal of the modelling process. Based on our experience we discuss how to build an MLP model and how to optimize the parameters and architecture. The process should be explained explicitly to make the MLP models more readily accepted by the ecological research community at large, as well as to make it possible to replicate the research.},

	abstract = {
Phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll (Chl) a, and net ecosystem production (NEP), were modeled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Chl a varied seasonally and along a saline gradient throughout the Neuse River (North Carolina). NEP was extremely dynamic in the Trout River (Florida), with phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions occurring over short-term intervals. Physical and chemical variables, arising from meteorological and hydrological conditions, created spatial and/or temporal gradients in both systems and served as interacting predictors for the trends/patterns of Chl a and NEP. ANNs outperformed comparable linear regression models and reliably modeled Chl a concentrations less than 20 [mu]g L-1 and NEP values, denoting the apparent non-linear interactions among abiotic and indicator variables. ANNs underestimated Chl a concentrations greater than 20 [mu]g L-1, likely due to the periodicity of data acquisition not being sufficient to generalize system variability, the designated [`]lag' effect for variables not being adequate to portray estuarine flow dynamics, the exclusion of (one or more) variables that would have improved prediction, and/or an unrealistic expectation of network performance. Variables indicative of meteorological and hydrological forcing and/or proxy measurements of phytoplankton had the greatest relative impact on prediction of Chl a and NEP. Except for their predictive capability, ANNs might appear to be of limited value for ecological applications and problem solving; interpreting the absolute impact of and/or interacting relationships among network variables is intrinsically difficult. Statistical methods or [`]rule extraction' algorithms that convey comprehensible network interpretation are needed prior to the routine use of ANNs in programs assessing and/or forecasting the response of biotic indicators to perturbation or for a means to discern estuarine function.},

	abstract = {We report a parallel algorithm applicable to a Euler-Lagrange model embedding four-way coupling. The model describing the dispersed phase dynamics accounts for bubble-bubble collisions and is parallelized using a mirror domain technique while the pressure Poisson equation for the continuous phase is solved using a domain decomposition technique implemented in the PETSc library [S. Balay, K. Buschelman, W.D. Gropp, D. Kaushik, M.G. Knepley, L.C. McInnes, B.F. Smith, H. Zhang, PETSc Web page: http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc, 2001]. The parallel algorithm is verified and it is found that it gives the same results for both phases as compared to the serial algorithm. Furthermore the algorithm shows good scalability up to 32 processors. Using the proposed method, a homogeneous bubbly flow in a laboratory scale bubble column can be simulated at very high gas hold-up (37%) while consuming a reasonable amount of calculation wall time.},

@article{Faller2006,
	abstract = {As a second step, and a critical milestone, in the development of a new simulation based design (SBD) tool based on recursive neural network (RNN) technologies the capability to change hull geometries and compute in real-time the new vehicle dynamics has been tested. Previously, this approach was successfully demonstrated for design changes on the ONR Body 1 submarine appendages (sternplane and rudder). The advantages of this RNN based tool are that simulation based design can be performed in a real-time nonlinear simulation (RNS) environment, and this approach enables the fusion of experimental data, when available, with steady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions. Building upon the previous work done using RNNs to support submarine simulation based design, the focus of this paper is on the extension of these RNN based approaches, and in particular for the design and modification of hull shape and size, including the computation of non-symmetric hull shapes. As in the previous SBD work on the appendages, a parent training data set for a particular vehicle was used to train an RNN to model how input forces and moments lead to particular output motions. Design changes to the vehicle were then implemented by changing the input force and moment database. As previously shown, appendages can be changed directly by specifying a new geometry and/or lift coefficient. As described herein, the hull geometry can be modified either through the use of other empirical data and/or through the use of steady RANS solutions. The new force and moment database for the hull and the new geometry are used as the input into the RNS based design code to determine the design change impact on vehicle maneuvering. Since only the input force and moment database is changed, no re-training of the RNN is required. As such, the new design simulations can be made in real-time, and the design cycle can, in theory, be shortened significantly. With the results for the hull geometry changes the full utility of this approach can now be defined, and bounds placed on the use of RNN based SBD approaches. This approach resolves the main limitation in RNN technology, namely that it was difficult or impossible to design vehicles using this technology. Now, RNNs can be used not only for vehicle design, but also to determine the result of the design changes in real-time.},

	abstract = {
Markovian population models are used in conservation biology to find an accurate estimate of a population's extinction probability. Such models require handling of large transition matrices and calculations are thus extremely time-consuming when large populations have to be studied. To accomplish these problems, some authors have suggested to group together several states/sizes of the population. Unfortunately, this so-called binning frequently results in errors in estimates obtained. The main problem with binning is that it assumes that grouped states behave nearly identical with respect to the underlying stochastic population process and that so far binning methods implicitly violate this assumption. In this paper, we present a new binning method based on self-organizing Kohonen neural networks for time-homogeneous Markovian metapopulation models. The neural networks are used to analyse one-step transitions of the Markov chain in order to group only nearly identical states. We show that the new method is more qualified for the use in conservation than deterministic methods that we had discussed in a previous paper (first order Fibonacci binning, pairs binning). It reveals more accurate and more reliable estimates than these methods. Errors in estimated extinction probabilities that were introduced by binning did not exceed one order of magnitude and errors in the global population size did not exceed 30%. These errors in estimates correspond to a low inaccuracy in model parameter values of population growth and migration ranging from $\pm$1 to $\pm$10%. The reduction in the state space of the studied metapopulations ranged from 21 to 33% per subpopulation. The resulting decrease in computing time caused by our binning method is substantial particularly with regard to simulations tasks such as comparing the extinction risk of several populations or performing a detailed sensitivity analysis for model parameters assumed. The successful estimation of the extinction risk of eight natural butterfly populations demonstrates the applicability of our new binning method in conservation biology. A comparison of extinction probabilities and mean population sizes estimated by Monte Carlo simulations [Griebeler, E.M., Seitz, A., 2002. An individual based model for the conservation of the endangered Large Blue butterfly, Maculinea arion (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Ecol. Model. 134, 343-356] with those obtained from the respective Markov chains for these butterfly populations revealed similar results on the accuracy of estimates and the reduction in transition matrices that were predicted by the comparative error analysis for binning methods.},

	abstract = { ABSTRACT Experiments are reported on the hydrodynamic performance of a flexible fin. The fin replicates some features of the pectoral fin of a batoid fish (such as a ray or skate) in that it is actuated in a travelling wave motion, with the amplitude of the motion increasing linearly along the span from root to tip. Thrust is found to increase with non-dimensional frequency, and an optimal oscillatory gait is identified. Power consumption measurements lead to the computation of propulsive efficiency, and an optimal efficiency condition is evaluated. Wake visualizations are presented, and a vortex model of the wake near zero net thrust is suggested. Strouhal number effects on the wake topology are also illustrated. },

Estimating intrinsic geometric properties of a surface from a polygonal mesh obtained from range data is an important stage of numerous algorithms in computer and robot vision, computer graphics, geometric modeling, and industrial and biomedical engineering. This work considers different computational schemes for local estimation of intrinsic curvature geometric properties. Four different algorithms and their modifications were tested on triangular meshes that represent tessellations of synthetic geometric models. The results were compared with the analytically computed values of the Gaussian and mean curvatures of the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) surfaces from which these meshes originated. The algorithms were also tested on range images of geometric objects. The results were compared with the analytic values of the Gaussian and mean curvatures of the scanned geometric objects. This work manifests the best algorithms suited for Gaussian and mean curvature estimation, and shows that different algorithms should be employed to compute the Gaussian and mean curvatures.},

@article{Choi2007,
	abstract = {
An immersed boundary method for time-dependent, three-dimensional, incompressible flows is presented in this paper. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized using a low-diffusion flux splitting method for the inviscid fluxes and second-order central-differences for the viscous components. Higher-order accuracy achieved by using weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) or total variation diminishing (TVD) schemes. An implicit method based on artificial compressibility and dual-time stepping is used for time advancement. The immersed boundary surfaces are defined as clouds of points, which may be structured or unstructured. Immersed-boundary objects are rendered as level sets in the computational domain, and concepts from computational geometry are used to classify points as being outside, near, or inside the immersed boundary. The velocity field near an immersed surface is determined from separate interpolations of the components tangent and normal to the surface. The tangential velocity near the surface is constructed as a power-law function of the local wall normal distance. Appropriate choices of the power law enable the method to approximate the energizing effects of a turbulent boundary layer for higher Reynolds number flows. Five different flow problems (flow over a circular cylinder, an in-line oscillating cylinder, a NACA0012 airfoil, a sphere, and a stationary mannequin) are simulated using the present immersed boundary method, and the predictions show good agreement with previous computational and experimental results. Finally, the flow induced by realistic human walking motion is simulated as an example of a problem involving multiple moving immersed objects.},

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully used to model primary production and have recently been tested for the prediction of harmful algae blooms. In this study, we evaluated the performance of feed forward ANN models trained to predict D. acuminata blooms. ANN models were trained and tested using weekly data (5 previous weeks) of D. acuminata cell counts from eight stations of the Andaluc{\`I}a HAB monitoring programme in the coasts of Huelva between 1998 and 2004. Principal component analysis (PCA) were previously carried out to find out possible similarities within time series from each zone with the aim of reducing the number of areas to model. Our results show that ANN models with a low number of input variables are able to reproduce trends in D. acuminata population dynamics.},

For the largest mass ratios, strong vortex pairs are distributed away from the wake centreline during intermittent violent snapping events, characterized by rapid changes in tension and dynamic buckling. },

	abstract = {The interface-capturing-fidelity issue of the level set method is addressed wholly within the Eulerian framework. Our aim is for a practical and efficient way to realize the expected benefits of grid resolution and high order schemes. Based on a combination of structured adaptive mesh refinement (SAMR), rather than quad/octrees, and on high-order spatial discretization, rather than the use of Lagrangian particles, our method is tailored to compressible flows, while it provides a potentially useful alternative to the particle level set (PLS) for incompressible flows. Interesting salient features of our method include (a) avoidance of limiting (in treating the Hamiltonian of the level set equation), (b) anchoring the level set in a manner that ensures no drift and no spurious oscillations of the zero level during PDE-reinitialization, and (c) a non-linear tagging procedure for defining the neighborhood of the interface subject to mesh refinement. Numerous computational results on a set of benchmark problems (strongly deforming, stretching and tearing interfaces) demonstrate that with this approach, implemented up to 11th order accuracy, the level set method becomes essentially free of mass conservation errors and also free of parasitic interfacial oscillations, while it is still highly efficient, and convenient for 3D parallel implementation. In addition, demonstration of performance in fully-coupled simulations is presented for multimode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (low-Mach number regime) and shock-induced, bubble-collapse (highly compressible regime).},

We all take our visual systems for granted, and often assume we are always [`]near perfect' observers. This is not the case; expert visual recognition is complex and can be error prone. Starting with examples that define the problem I will explore some of the issues of recognition where expert judgements are required.
In addition to [`]expert' effects, there are a number of cognitive factors that can severely affect performance, including fatigue, boredom, recency effects, positivity bias and short-term memory effects. Experimental evidence of the impact of these on performance are presented and discussed.
The specimen identifications generated by experts are useful not only to ecology, but to researchers developing systems for automatic labelling of marine plankton. Comparisons of performance are presented, where human experts have been pitted against machines to label plankton. Consensus of opinion is important in reducing errors, yet it is the norm for experts to operate alone. The shortcomings of man and machines engaged in plankton recognition are reviewed and the future of automation is assessed.},

Remote sensing has considerable potential for the provision of information on the distribution of habitats that may be used to inform a variety of activities such as those required through the European Union's Habitats Directive. Such programmes are often resource-limited with a need for innovative methods that optimise resource use. This paper explores two approaches to resource savings when mapping habitats from remotely sensed imagery. The first approach realises that in an area of study often interest is focused on a specific habitat with the remaining land cover classes in the region of no importance. In such circumstances conventional statistical supervised classification analyses may be inefficient and yield a map of sub-optimal accuracy. The second approach seeks to further reduce the training requirements of a supervised classification. For this support vector machine (SVM) based approaches to classification are explored to map coastal saltmarsh habitats in North Norfolk, UK from a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) image. A series of classifications using SVM based approaches and the Maximum Likelihood classifier (MLC) were undertaken. Classification accuracies were significantly higher using the SVM based approaches (e.g., 92.0% overall accuracy) than the MLC (64.8% overall accuracy). The SVM based classifications were demonstrated to be attractive for mapping a priority habitat in that the focus is on the habitat of interest to be mapped throughout the classification process resulting in a reduced need for training data. Moreover, it was shown that this can be further optimised through the use of intelligent training. This approach, based on the use of the support vector data description (SVDD), saved resource requirements even further in that training data were required only for the class of interest and yet still obtained high classification accuracies (95.2% overall accuracy) . The wider adoption of SVM based classification of remotely sensed imagery is advocated for use in conservation activities.},

A deep understanding on the intrinsic mechanism is required to develop a highly specialized mechanistic model for ecosystem dynamics. However, it is usually hard to do for most of the ecological and environmental problems, because of the lack of a consistent theoretical background. Neural networks are universal and flexible models for linear and non-linear systems. This paper aimed to modeling an ecosystem using neural network models and the conventional model, and assessing their effectiveness in the dynamic simulation of ecosystem. Elman neural network model, linear neural network model, and linear ordinary differential equation were developed to simulate the dynamics of Chinese cabbage growth system recorded in the field. Matlab codes for these neural network models were given. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to detect the robustness of these models.
The results showed that Elman neural network model could simulate the multivariate non-linear system at the desired accuracy. Linear neural network model may simulate such a non-linear system only in certain conditions. Conventional linear ordinary differential equation yielded divergent outputs in the dynamic simulation of the multivariate non-linear system.
Sensitivity analysis indicated that the learning rate influenced the simulation performance of linear neural network model. Transfer function of the second layer in Elman neural network model would influence the simulation performance of this model, but little influence was produced when other functions were changed. Elman neural network was proven to be a robust model. Sensitivity analysis showed that the different choices of functions and parameters in neural network model would influence the performance of simulation. Sensitivity analysis is therefore powerful to detect the robustness and stability of neural network models.},

This paper proposes a distributive genetic algorithm for the learning of neural networks (DGANN). To tackle several well-known problems for conventional genetic algorithms (GAs), a synergetic multi-operator multi-population mechanism is developed, incorporating an [alpha] transformation crossover operator and mixed-crossover operators. The proposed algorithm is applied to both benchmark numerical examples and pattern recognition of blue-green algae in lakes. Experimental results confirm that the proposed algorithm is superior to conventional GAs in terms of the convergence speed and solution precision, and is also capable of generating neural networks with significantly improved generalization performance.},

Reservoirs provide approximately 70% of water supply for domestic and industrial use in Taiwan. The water quality of reservoirs is now one of the key factors in the operation and water quality management of reservoirs. Transient weather patterns result in highly variable magnitudes of precipitation and thereby sharp fluctuations in the surface elevation of the reservoirs. In addition, excessive watershed development in the past two decades has contributed to continuing increase in nutrient loads to the reservoirs. The difficulty in quantifying watershed nutrient loads and uncentainties in kinetic mechanism in the water column present a technical challenge to the mass balance based modeling of reservoir eutrophication. This study offers an alternative approach to quantifying the cause-and-effect relationship in reservoir eutrophication with a data-driven method, i.e., capturing non-linear relationships among the water quality variables in the reservoir. A commonly used back-propagation neural network was used to relate the key factors that influence a number of water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and secchi disk depth (SD) in a reservoir in central Taiwan. Study results show that the neural network is able to predict these indicators with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that the neural network is a valuable tool for reservoir management in Taiwan.},

As water movements in the wake of fishes can persist for several minutes, hydrodynamic trails of considerable length are generated. It has been demonstrated that seals can use their vibrissae to detect and track hydrodynamic trails generated artificially by miniature submarines. In the present study, we trained a harbour seal to swim predefined courses, thus generating biogenic hydrodynamic trails. The structure of these trails was measured using Particle Image Velocimetry. A second seal was trained to search for and track the trail after the trail-generating seal had left the water. Our trail-following seal was able to detect and accurately track the hydrodynamic trail, showing search patterns either mostly congruent with the trail or crossing the trail repeatedly in an undulatory way. The undulatory trail-following search pattern might allow a seal to relocate a lost trail or successfully track a fleeing, zigzagging prey fish.},

@article{Besnard2007,
	abstract = {This paper presents a neural network-based response surface method for reducing the cost of computer-intensive optimizations for applications in ship design. In the approach, complex or costly analyses are replaced by a neural network, which is used to instantaneously estimate the value of the function(s) of interest. The cost of the optimization is shifted to the generation of (smaller) data sets used for training the network. The focus of the paper is on the use and analysis of constructive networks, as opposed to networks of fixed size, for treating problems with a large number of variables, say around 30. The advantages offered by constructive networks are emphasized, leading to the selection and discussion of the cascade correlation algorithm. This topology allows for efficient neural network determination when dealing with function representation over large design spaces without requiring prior experience from the user. During training, the network grows until the error on a small set (validation set), different from that used in the training itself (training set), starts increasing. The method is validated for a mathematical function for dimensions ranging from 5 to 30, and the importance of analyzing the error on a set other than the training set is emphasized. The approach is then applied to the automated computational fluid dynamics-based shape optimization of a fast ship configuration known as the twin H-body. The classical approach yields a design improvement of 26%, whereas the neural network-based method allows reaching a 34% improvement at one fifth of the cost of the former. Based on the analysis of the results, areas for future improvements and research are outlined. The results demonstrate the potential of the method in saving valuable development cycle time and increasing the performance of future ship designs.},

Algae blooms are ecological events associated with extremely high abundance value of certain algae. These rare events have a strong impact in the river's ecosystem. In this context, the prediction of such events is of special importance. This paper addresses the problems that result from evaluating and comparing models at the prediction of rare extreme values using standard evaluation statistics. In this context, we describe a new evaluation statistic that we have proposed in Torgo and Ribeiro [Torgo, L., Ribeiro, R., 2006. Predicting rare extreme values. In: Ng, W., Kitsuregawa, M., Li, J., Chang, K. (Eds.), Proceedings of the 10th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discover and Data Mining (PAKDD'2006). Springer, pp. 816-820 (number 3918 in LNAI)], which can be used to identify the best models for predicting algae blooms. We apply this new statistic in a comparative study involving several models for predicting the abundance of different groups of phytoplankton in water samples collected in Douro River, Porto, Portugal. Results show that the proposed statistic identifies a variant of a Support Vector Machine as outperforming the other models that were tried in the prediction of algae blooms.},

	abstract = {
The immersed boundary method is one of the most useful computational methods in studying fluid structure interaction. On the other hand, the Immersed Boundary method is also known to require small time steps to maintain stability when solved with an explicit method. Many implicit or approximately implicit methods have been proposed in the literature to remove this severe time step stability constraint, but none of them give satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient semi-implicit scheme to remove this stiffness from the immersed boundary method for the Navier-Stokes equations. The construction of our semi-implicit scheme consists of two steps. First, we obtain a semi-implicit discretization which is proved to be unconditionally stable. This unconditionally stable semi-implicit scheme is still quite expensive to implement in practice. Next, we apply the small scale decomposition to the unconditionally stable semi-implicit scheme to construct our efficient semi-implicit scheme. Unlike other implicit or semi-implicit schemes proposed in the literature, our semi-implicit scheme can be solved explicitly in the spectral space. Thus the computational cost of our semi-implicit schemes is comparable to that of an explicit scheme. Our extensive numerical experiments show that our semi-implicit scheme has much better stability property than an explicit scheme. This offers a substantial computational saving in using the immersed boundary method.},

@article{Selle2008,
	abstract = {The back and forth error compensation and correction (BFECC) method advects the solution forward and then backward in time. The result is compared to the original data to estimate the error. Although inappropriate for parabolic and other non-reversible partial differential equations, it is useful for often troublesome advection terms. The error estimate is used to correct the data before advection raising the method to second order accuracy, even though each individual step is only first order accurate. In this paper, we rewrite the MacCormack method to illustrate that it estimates the error in the same exact fashion as BFECC. The difference is that the MacCormack method uses this error estimate to correct the already computed forward advected data. Thus, it does not require the third advection step in BFECC reducing the cost of the method while still obtaining second order accuracy in space and time. Recent work replaced each of the three BFECC advection steps with a simple first order accurate unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian method yielding a second order accurate unconditionally stable BFECC scheme. We use a similar approach to create a second order accurate unconditionally stable MacCormack method.},

We present a scheme-dependent Kolmogorov scaling analysis of the solutions produced by such methods. From this analysis we can define an effective Reynolds number for implicit LES simulations of inviscid flow. The approach can also be used to define an effective Reynolds number for under-resolved viscous simulations. Simulations of maintained homogeneous isotropic turbulence and the Taylor--Green vortex are presented to support this proposal and highlight similarities and differences with real-world viscous fluids. Direct comparison with data from high resolution DNS calculations provides validation of the effective viscosity and effective Kolmogorov length scale.},

	abstract = {n January 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency sponsored a ``roundtable discussion'' to develop a consensus on the relationship between eutrophication and harmful algal blooms (HABs), specifically targeting those relationships for which management actions may be appropriate. Academic, federal, and state agency representatives were in attendance. The following seven statements were unanimously adopted by attendees based on review and analysis of current as well as pertinent previous data:
(1) Degraded water quality from increased nutrient pollution promotes the development and persistence of many HABs and is one of the reasons for their expansion in the U.S. and other nations;
(2) The composition--not just the total quantity--of the nutrient pool impacts HABs;
(3) High-biomass blooms must have exogenous nutrients to be sustained;
(4) Both chronic and episodic nutrient delivery promote HAB development;
(5) Recently developed tools and techniques are already improving the detection of some HABs, and emerging technologies are rapidly advancing toward operational status for the prediction of HABs and their toxins;
(6) Experimental studies are critical to further the understanding about the role of nutrients in HABs expression, and will strengthen prediction and mitigation of HABs; and
(7) Management of nutrient inputs to the watershed can lead to significant reduction in HABs.
Supporting evidence and pertinent examples for each consensus statement are provided herein.},

	abstract = {The use of biomechanical modelling, especially in conjunction with finite element analysis, has become common in many areas of medical image analysis and surgical simulation. Clinical employment of such techniques is hindered by conflicting requirements for high fidelity in the modelling approach, and fast solution speeds. We report the development of techniques for high-speed nonlinear finite element analysis for surgical simulation. We use a fully nonlinear total Lagrangian explicit finite element formulation which offers significant computational advantages for soft tissue simulation. However, the key contribution of the work is the presentation of a fast graphics processing unit (GPU) solution scheme for the finite element equations. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first GPU implementation of a nonlinear finite element solver. We show that the present explicit finite element scheme is well suited to solution via highly parallel graphics hardware, and that even a midrange GPU allows significant solution speed gains (up to 16.8 times) compared with equivalent CPU implementations. For the models tested the scheme allows real-time solution of models with up to 16 000 tetrahedral elements. The use of GPUs for such purposes offers a cost-effective high-performance alternative to expensive multi-CPU machines, and may have important applications in medical image analysis and surgical simulation.},

High biomass algal bloom events are a characteristic of eutrophic coastal waters; these may result both in ecosystem degradation and economic loss. We present a skill evaluation of a coupled hydrodynamic ecosystem model of the NW European shelf for predicting bloom events based on a comparison with satellite chlorophyll estimates. By setting thresholds to define bloom events we use a binary classification system to generate maps showing the probability a model bloom prediction is correct. Model and satellite data limitations are discussed along with the application of this method to forecasting specific harmful algal species.},

@article{Jeong2008,
	abstract = {
This study was aimed at developing a Temporal Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network (TARNN) model that could predict time-series changes of phytoplankton dynamics in a regulated river ecosystem in South Korea. In recent years, a large quantity of ecological data has been globally accumulated in habitats monitored by Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER), and that data enabled ecologists to apply non-linear data-driven ecological modelling algorithms to their systems. Numerous studies have reported that empirical modelling algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were superior to conventional models in applicability, especially for systems where underlying ecological relationship was not fully understood. However, in order to process sufficient information from the target ecosystem or entity, the size of empirical models tended to become larger by applying diverse state variables or forcing functions to the models. Despite the fact that the developed models empirically had accurate performance in prediction or classification of target data, they are occasionally not free from complex structures (e.g., large number of input variables). The TARNN algorithm used in this study can be an alternative solution to overcome the increasing size and structural complexity of the models, based on model performance, which is hardly found in freshwater ecology. In this study, the performance of TARNN for freshwater ecological data was evaluated by being applied to two types of data sets of phytoplankton dynamics. The first data encompassed intensive seasonality (monthly averaged biovolume of Stephanodiscus hantzschii) which proliferated and dominated the algal assemblage (ca. 90%) annually in the lower Nakdong River during winters. The other data was daily sampled phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in which significant seasonality did not reside. The predictability of two TARNN models was compared with appropriate statistical models, i.e., data with seasonality was modelled by Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA), and the other data with Simple Exponential Smoothing. In both cases of data sets, the TARNN models outperformed the statistical methods in accuracy of prediction (TARNN, r2 > 0.9 for both seasonal and non-seasonal testing data sets; both statistical models, r2 &lt; 0.3 for the testing data sets). Especially, the capacity of prediction using the TARNN algorithm was not decreased by the absence of seasonality. Through the presented results, it can be assumed that TARNN can process non-linear autoregressive analysis successfully for ecological data. The development of non-linear autoregressive models for phytoplankton prediction can suggest more efficient direction for water quality management approaches of freshwater systems with long-term database. A real-time forecasting system for algal proliferation, one of the state-of-the-art predicting systems, can be identified using the linkage between the modelling technique and telemetry.},

@article{Nourgaliev2008,
	abstract = {We introduce a sharp interface method (SIM) for the direct numerical simulation of unstable fluid-fluid interfaces. The method is based on the level set approach and the structured adaptive mesh refinement technology, endowed with a corridor of irregular, cut-cell grids that resolve the interfacial region to third-order spatial accuracy. Key in that regard are avoidance of numerical mixing, and a least-squares interpolation method that is supported by irregular datasets distinctly on each side of the interface. Results on test problems show our method to be free of the spurious current problem of the continuous surface force method and to converge, on grid refinement, at near-theoretical rates. Simulations of unstable Rayleigh-Taylor and viscous Kelvin-Helmholtz flows are found to converge at near-theoretical rates to the exact results over a wide range of conditions. Further, we show predictions of neutral-stability maps of the viscous Kelvin-Helmholtz flows (Yih instability), as well as self-selection of the most unstable wave-number in multimode simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. All these results were obtained with a simple seeding of random infinitesimal disturbances of interface-shape, as opposed to seeding by a complete eigenmode. For other than elementary flows the latter would normally not be available, and extremely difficult to obtain if at all. Sample comparisons with our code adapted to mimic typical diffuse interface treatments were not satisfactory for shear-dominated flows. On the other hand the sharp dynamics of our method would appear to be compatible and possibly advantageous to any interfacial flow algorithm in which the interface is represented as a discrete Heaviside function.},

@article{Eames2008,
	abstract = {We study the rapid dissolution of a dense rigid body (a cylinder or sphere; density ρp), fixed in a uniform flow of speed U (density ρf), within an inviscid framework. The body consists of N shells, and dissolves through a series of discrete steps, where after each shell dissolves, it is pushed out by a radial flow. The flow through the surface of the body pushes bound vorticity into the ambient flow, creating free vorticity and satisfying, at the same time, Kelvin's circulation theorem. The circulation of each shell is described by a Lagrangian equation describing the position of each shell and an integral relationship between the circulation of the shells dissolved and the bound vorticity. The thermal component is neglected from this analysis.

The impulse of the exterior fluid increases to compensate for the decrease in the momentum of the body. The bodies are fixed as they dissolve so that the sum of the flow impulse and body momentum is only approximately conserved. The impulse of the vorticity field created after the body has disappeared, IT, is approximately equal to the initial momentum of the body, ρpUV (where V is the initial volume of the body). The total circulation in the upper half-plane is Γ≈Γ0+CΓ(ρp/ρf)1/Na0U, where N=2, 3 for a cylinder, sphere, respectively, and CΓ∼O(1) a constant. The total kinetic energy associated with the vorticity field after the body has disappeared is T∼(1/2)ρpCTVU2, where CT<1. The sum of the kinetic energy of the flow and body is not conserved.

After the cylinder/sphere has disappeared, the vorticity distribution rolls up to produce a dipolar vortex/vortex ring. The properties of these dipolar structures are estimated assuming a final form and the conservation of T, Γ and IT. A dense cylinder dissolves to create a vortex that has a radius 1.3a0(ρp/ρf)1/2 and moves with a speed 0.28U, while a dense sphere dissolves to create a vortex of radius 0.65a0(ρp/ρf)1/3, which moves with a speed 0.50U.},

There is a growing interest in support vector machines (SVMs) as tools in ecological prediction and classification. SVMs use separating hyperplanes and exploit theorems bounding the actual risk by the empirical risk to find the optimal decision rule. SVMs do not rely on any distributional assumptions or asymptotic arguments and therefore can be used on small data sets. They are especially valuable for high-dimensional data. This article introduces the underlying mathematical theory of SVMs and discusses their use in ecological investigations.},

	abstract = {Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of long flexible cylindrical structures enduring ocean currents is ubiquitous in the offshore industry. Though significant effort has gone into understanding this complicated fluid-structure interaction problem, major challenges remain in modeling and predicting the response of such structures. The work presented in this thesis provides a systematic approach to estimate and analyze the vortex-induced motions and forces on a marine riser, and develop suitable methods to improve riser VIV modeling and response prediction. In the first part of the thesis, a systematic framework is developed, which allows reconstruction of the riser motion from a limited number of sensors placed along its length. A perfect reconstruction criterion is developed, which allows us to classify when the measurements from the sensors contain all information pertinent to VIV response, and when they do not, in which case additional, analytical methods must be employed. Reconstruction methods for both scenarios are developed and applied to experimental data. The methods are applied to: develop tools for in-situ estimation of fatigue damage on marine risers; improve understanding of the vortex shedding mechanisms, including the presence of traveling waves and higher-harmonic forces; and estimate the vortex-induced forces on marine risers. In the second part of the thesis, a method is developed to improve the modeling of riser VIV by extracting empirical lift coefficient databases from field riser VIV measurements. The existing experiment-based lift coefficient databases are represented in a flexible parameterized form using a set of carefully chosen parameters. Extraction of the lift coefficient parameters is posed as an optimization problem, where the error between the prediction using a theoretical model and the experimental data is minimized. Predictions using the new databases are found to significantly reduce the error in estimating the riser cross-flow response. Finally, data from a comprehensive experiment is utilized to show that the riser response is resonant in the harmonic component, but non-resonant in the third-harmonic component. It is shown that this happens because the spatial dependence of the third-harmonic fluid force component is dominated by the first-harmonic wavelengths. This finding has significant implications for modeling the higher-harmonic forces and the resulting fatigue damage estimation methodologies.},

@article{Le2009,
	abstract = {
We present an implicit immersed boundary method for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations capable of handling three-dimensional membrane-fluid flow interactions. The goal of our approach is to greatly improve the time step by using the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to advance the location of the elastic membrane implicitly. The most attractive feature of this Jacobian-free approach is Newton-like nonlinear convergence without the cost of forming and storing the true Jacobian. The Generalized Minimal Residual method (GMRES), which is a widely used Krylov-subspace iterative method, is used to update the search direction required for each Newton iteration. Each GMRES iteration only requires the action of the Jacobian in the form of matrix-vector products and therefore avoids the need of forming and storing the Jacobian matrix explicitly. Once the location of the boundary is obtained, the elastic forces acting at the discrete nodes of the membrane are computed using a finite element model. We then use the immersed boundary method to calculate the hydrodynamic effects and fluid-structure interaction effects such as membrane deformation. The present scheme has been validated by several examples including an oscillatory membrane initially placed in a still fluid, capsule membranes in shear flows and large deformation of red blood cells subjected to stretching force.},

The paper describes the training, validation and application of artificial neural network (ANN) models for computing the dissolved oxygen (DO) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels in the Gomti river (India). Two ANN models were identified, validated and tested for the computation of DO and BOD concentrations in the Gomti river water. Both the models employed eleven input water quality variables measured in river water over a period of 10 years each month at eight different sites. The performance of the ANN models was assessed through the coefficient of determination (R2) (square of the correlation coefficient), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias computed from the measured and model computed values of the dependent variables. Goodness of the model fit to the data was also evaluated through the relationship between the residuals and model computed values of DO and BOD. The model computed values of DO and BOD by both the ANN models were in close agreement with their respective measured values in the river water. Relative importance and contribution of the input variables to the model output was evaluated through the partitioning approach. The identified ANN models can be used as tools for the computation of water quality parameters.},

	abstract = {A novel immersed boundary (IB) method has been developed for simulating multi-material heat transfer problem - a cylinder in a channel heated from below with mixed convection. The method is based on a second-order velocity/scalar reconstruction near the IB. A novel algorithm has been developed for the IB method to handle conjugate heat transfer. The fluid-solid interface is constructed as a collection of disjoint faces of control volumes associated to different material zones. Coupling conditions for the material zones have been developed such that continuity and conservation of the scalar flux are satisfied by a second-order interpolation. Predictions of the local Nusselt number on the cylinder surface show good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of the Boussinesq approximation on this problem was also investigated. Comparison with the variable density formulation suggests that, in spite of a small thermal expansion coefficient of water, the variable density formulation in a transitional flow with mixed convection is preferable.},

	abstract = {
The Santa Barbara Channel, CA is a highly productive region where wind-driven upwelling and mesoscale eddies are important processes driving phytoplankton blooms. In recent years, the spring bloom has been dominated by the neurotoxin-producing diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. In this paper, we relate a 1.5-year time series of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance and domoic acid concentration to physical, chemical, and biological data to better understand the mechanisms controlling local Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom dynamics. The data were used to define the ranges of environmental conditions associated with Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom development in the Santa Barbara Channel. The time series captured three large toxic events (max. particulate domoic acid concentration, pDA ~6000 ng L-1; max. cellular domoic acid concentrations, cDA ~88 pg cell-1) in the springs of 2005-2006 and summer 2005 corresponding to bloom-level Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance (>5.0 × 104 cells L-1). In general, large increases in Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundance were accompanied by increases in cDA levels, and cDA peaks preceded pDA peaks by at least one month in both the springs of 2005 and 2006. Statistical models incorporating satellite ocean color (MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS) and sea surface temperature (AVHRR) data were created to determine the probability that a remotely sensed phytoplankton bloom contains a significant population of toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Models correctly estimate 98% of toxic bloom situations, with a 7-29% rate of false positive identification. Conditions most associated with high cDA levels are low sea surface temperature, high salinity, increased absorption by cDOM (412 nm), increased reflectance at 510/555 nm, and decreased particulate absorption at 510 nm. Future efforts to merge satellite and regionally downscaled forecasting products with these habitat models will help assess bloom forecasting capabilities in the central CA region and any potential connections to large-scale climate modes.},

	abstract = {Burst-and-coast swimming performance in fish-like locomotion is studied via two-dimensional numerical simulation. The numerical method used is the collocated finite-volume adaptive Cartesian cut-cell method developed previously. The NACA00×× airfoil shape is used as an equilibrium fish-body form. Swimming in a burst-and-coast style is computed assuming that the burst phase is composed of a single tail-beat. Swimming efficiency is evaluated in terms of the mass-specific cost of transport instead of the Froude efficiency. The effects of the Reynolds number (based on the body length and burst time), duty cycle and fineness ratio (the body length over the largest thickness) on swimming performance (momentum capacity and the mass-specific cost of transport) are studied quantitatively. The results lead to a conclusion consistent with previous findings that a larval fish seldom swims in a burst-and-coast style. Given mass and swimming speed, a fish needs the least cost if it swims in a burst-and-coast style with a fineness ratio of 8.33. This energetically optimal fineness ratio is larger than that derived from the simple hydromechanical model proposed in literature. The calculated amount of energy saving in burst-and-coast swimming is comparable with the real-fish estimation in the literature. Finally, the predicted wake-vortex structures of both continuous and burst-and-coast swimming are biologically relevant.},

@article{Kang2009a,
	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the immersed boundary (IB) method to predict the wall pressure fluctuations in turbulent flows, where the flow dynamics in the near-wall region is fundamental to correctly predict the overall flow. The present approach achieves sufficient accuracy at the immersed boundary and overcomes deficiencies in previous IB methods by introducing additional constraints - a compatibility for the interpolated velocity boundary condition related to mass conservation and the formal decoupling of the pressure on this surfaces. The immersed boundary-approximated domain method (IB-ADM) developed in the present study satisfies these conditions with an inexpensive computational overhead. The IB-ADM correctly predicts the near-wall velocity, pressure and scalar fields in several example problems, including flows around a very thin solid object for which incorrect results were obtained with previous IB methods. In order to have sufficient near-wall mesh resolution for LES and DNS computations, the present approach uses local mesh refinement. The present method has been also successfully applied to computation of the wall-pressure space-time correlation in DNS of turbulent channel flow on grids not aligned with the boundaries. When applied to a turbulent flow around an airfoil, the computed flow statistics - the mean/RMS flow field and power spectra of the wall pressure - are in good agreement with experiment.},

A dispersion-relation-preserving dual-compact scheme developed in Cartesian grids is applied together with the immersed boundary method to solve the flow equations in irregular and time-varying domains. The artificial momentum forcing term applied at certain points in cells containing fluid and solid allows an imposition of velocity condition to account for the motion of solid body. We develop in this study a differential-based interpolation scheme which can be easily extended to three-dimensional simulation. The results simulated from the proposed immersed boundary method agree well with other numerical and experimental results for the chosen benchmark problems. The accuracy and fidelity of the IB flow solver developed to predict flows with irregular boundaries are therefore demonstrated.},

	abstract = {In the present work we developed a structured adaptive mesh refinement (S-AMR) strategy for fluid-structure interaction problems in laminar and turbulent incompressible flows. The computational grid consists of a number of nested grid blocks at different refinement levels. The coarsest grid blocks always cover the entire computational domain, and local refinement is achieved by the bisection of selected blocks in every coordinate direction. The grid topology and data-structure is managed using the Paramesh toolkit. The filtered Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow are advanced in time using an explicit second-order projection scheme, where all spatial derivatives are approximated using second order central differences on a staggered grid. For transitional and turbulent flow regimes the large-eddy simulation (LES) approach is used, where special attention is paid on the discontinuities introduced by the local refinement. For all the fluid-structure interaction problems reported in this study the complete set of equations governing the dynamics of the flow and the structure are simultaneously advanced in time using a predictor-corrector strategy. An embedded-boundary method is utilized to enforce the boundary conditions on a complex moving body which is not aligned with the grid lines. Several examples of increasing complexity are given to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.},

Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is the most prevalent form of phycotoxin-borne seafood poisoning in the world. It afflicts tens of thousands of individuals annually resulting in economic impacts on the order of tens of millions of dollars per year in the United States alone. One of the biggest hurdles hindering management strategies to monitor for and limit exposure to CFP is the sporadic nature of CFP outbreaks, both spatially and temporally. The purpose of this effort was to develop a simple, one-dimensional model that used essential physico-chemical parameters to adequately simulate the population dynamics of the causative organism behind CFP events, the benthic dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus spp. The design data for this model came from seasonally comprehensive information for Gambierdiscus cell density and associated nutrient and physico-chemical data that were collected monthly over 3.5 years at two windward and two leeward sites on the island of Hawaii. Data from the windward sites were used to construct and calibrate the model, which was then verified against actual Gambierdiscus cell density values that were collected at the leeward sites. Additional modeling scenarios indicated that bloom scenarios resulted from subtle (yet complementary) changes in environmental conditions, and that nutrient enrichment and warming sea surface temperatures stimulated Gambierdiscus growth and resulted in higher cell densities. The results from this proof-of-concept effort to simulate the population densities of this benthic dinoflagellate suggest promise for more elaborate modeling efforts, and their potential value to protect against human impacts from future CFP outbreaks.},

In the present study, classification trees (CTs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were used to study habitat suitability for 30 macroinvertebrate taxa in the Du river in Northern Vietnam. The presence/absence of the 30 most common macroinvertebrate taxa was modelled based on 21 physical-chemical and structural variables. The predictive performance of the CT and SVM models was assessed based on the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances (CCI) and Cohen's kappa statistics. The results of the present study demonstrated that SVMs performed better than CTs. Attribute weighing in SVMs could replace the application of genetic algorithms for input variable selection. By weighing attributes, SVMs provided quantitative correlations between environmental variables and the occurrence of macroinvertebrates and thus allowed better ecological interpretation. SVMs thus proved to have a high potential when applied for decision-making in the context of river restoration and conservation management.},

A computationally efficient and second-order VOF reconstruction method is presented which uses no inversions to determine the interface normal direction. Next, the lack of conservation of fluid volume in previous VOF advection methods are shown to be due to improper treatment of one-dimensional stretching in the velocity field. This paper uses simple explicit time stepping and a cell-center estimate of the volume fraction in the dilatation term to achieve a completely conservative advection method. The new methods are simple, robust and shown to out perform existing approaches for canonical test problems relevant to breaking wave flows.},

@article{Liovic2010,
	abstract = {In this paper, three improvements for modelling surface tension-dominated interfacial flows using interface tracking-based solution algorithms are presented. We have developed an improved approach to curvature estimation for incorporation into modern mesh-based surface tension models such as the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) and Sharp Surface Force (SSF) models. The scheme involves generating samples of curvature estimates from the multitude of height functions that can be generated from VOF representations of interfaces, and applying quality statistics based on interface orientation and smoothness to choose optimal candidates from the samples. In this manner, the orientation-dependence of past schemes for height function-based curvature estimation is ameliorated, the use of compact stencils for efficient computation can be maintained, and robustness is enhanced even in the presence of noticeable subgrid-scale disturbances in the interface representation. For surface tension-dominated flows, the explicit capillary timestep restriction is relaxed through timescale-separated slope limiting that identifies spurious modes in curvature evolution and omits them from contributing to surface force computations, thus promoting efficiency in simulation through the use of less timesteps. Efficiency in flow simulation is further promoted by incorporating awareness of interface location into multigrid preconditioning for Krylov subspace-based solution of elliptic problems. This use of interface-cognizance in solving problems such as the Helmholtz equation and the Poisson equation enables multigrid-like convergence in discontinuous-coefficient elliptic problems without the expense of constructing the Galerkin coarse-grid operator. The key improvements in the surface tension modelling and the numerical linear algebra are also applicable to level-set-based interfacial flow simulation.},

	abstract = {
Direct forcing methods are a class of methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on nonrectangular domains. The physical domain is embedded into a larger, rectangular domain, and the equations of motion are solved on this extended domain. The boundary conditions are enforced by applying forces near the embedded boundaries. This raises the question of how the flow outside the physical domain influences the flow inside the physical domain. This question is particularly relevant when using a projection method for incompressible flow. In this paper, analysis and computational tests are presented that explore the performance of projection methods when used with direct forcing methods. Sufficient conditions for the success of projection methods on extended domains are derived, and it is shown how forcing methods meet these conditions. Bounds on the error due to projecting on the extended domain are derived, and it is shown that direct forcing methods are, in general, first-order accurate in the max-norm. Numerical tests of the projection alone confirm the analysis and show that this error is concentrated near the embedded boundaries, leading to higher-order accuracy in integral norms. Generically, forcing methods generate a solution that is not smooth across the embedded boundaries, and it is this lack of smoothness which limits the accuracy of the methods. Additional computational tests of the Navier-Stokes equations involving a direct forcing method and a projection method are presented, and the results are compared with the predictions of the analysis. These results confirm that the lack of smoothness in the solution produces a lower-order error. The rate of convergence attained in practice depends on the type of forcing method used.},

	abstract = {
Galloping, also known as Den Hartog instability, is the large amplitude, low frequency oscillation of a structure in the direction transverse to the mean wind direction. It normally appears in the case of bodies with small stiffness and structural damping, when they are placed in a flow provided the incident velocity is high enough. Galloping depends on the slope of the lift coefficient versus angle of attack curve, which must be negative. Generally speaking this implies that the body is stalled after boundary layer separation, which, as it is known in non-wedged bodies, is a Reynolds number dependent phenomenon. Wind tunnel experiments have been conducted aiming at establishing the characteristics of the galloping motion of elliptical cross-section bodies when subjected to a uniform flow, the angles of attack ranging from 0∞ to 90∞. The results have been summarized in stability maps, both in the angle of attack versus relative thickness and in the angle of attack versus Reynolds number planes, where galloping instability regions are identified.},

Ecological data are considered to be difficult to analyze because numerous biological and environmental factors are involved in a complex manner in environment-organism relationships. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) has advantages for information extraction (i.e., without prior knowledge) and the efficiency of presentation (i.e., visualization). It has been implemented broadly in ecological sciences across different hierarchical levels of life. Recent applications of the SOM, which are reviewed here, include the molecular, organism, population, community, and ecosystem scales. Further development of the SOM is discussed regarding network architecture, spatio-temporal patterning, and the presentation of model results in ecological sciences.},

In this study we determined the maximum time after which a harbour seal could indicate the moving direction of an artificial fish tail and analysed the hydrodynamic parameters allowing the discrimination. Hydrodynamic trails were generated using a fin-like paddle moving from left to right or from right to left in the calm water of an experimental box. The blindfolded seal was able to recognise the direction of the paddle movement when the hydrodynamic trail was up to 35 s old. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) revealed that the seal might have perceived and used two different hydrodynamic parameters to determine the moving direction of the fin-like paddle. The structure and spatial arrangement of the vortices in the hydrodynamic trail and high water velocities between two counter-rotating vortices are characteristic of the movement direction and are within the sensory range of the seal. 10.1242/jeb.041699},

This allows approximating the ship motion through a set of equations which are mathematically equivalent to those governing the unsteady 2D free-surface flow generated by a deformable body in the vertical plane transverse to the ship. To describe the body deformation, a proper modeling of the solid boundaries is needed. To this purpose the fixed ghost particle technique recently developed by the authors for 2D SPH schemes is adopted. Then, an in-depth analysis of the bow breaking wave evolution is provided focusing on the different features of the plunging jet as function of the ship forward velocity. The comparison with experimental data proves the proposed SPH scheme to be robust and accurate.},

@article{Yan2011,
	abstract = {
A highly efficient high-order boundary element method is developed for the numerical simulation of nonlinear wave-wave and wave-body interactions in the context of potential flow. The method is based on the framework of the quadratic boundary element method (QBEM) for the boundary integral equation and uses the pre-corrected fast Fourier transform (PFFT) algorithm to accelerate the evaluation of far-field influences of source and/or normal dipole distributions on boundary elements. The resulting PFFT-QBEM reduces the computational effort of solving the associated boundary-value problem from O(N2~3) (with the traditional QBEM) to O(N ln N) where N represents the total number of boundary unknowns. Significantly, it allows for reliable computations of nonlinear hydrodynamics useful in ship design and marine applications, which are forbidden with the traditional methods on the presently available computing platforms. The formulation and numerical issues in the development and implementation of the PFFT-QBEM are described in detail. The characteristics of accuracy and efficiency of the PFFT-QBEM for various boundary-value problems are studied and compared to those of the existing accelerated (lower- and higher-order) boundary element methods. To illustrate the usefulness of the PFFT-QBEM, it is applied to solve the initial boundary-value problem in the generation of three-dimensional nonlinear waves by a moving ship hull. The predicted wave profile and resistance on the ship are compared to available experimental measurements with satisfactory agreements.},

We also discuss the quadratic reconstruction and fourth-order accurate expressions of the normal and curvature. We present a hierarchical algorithm to compute the normal vector and curvature of an interface line with the height function method that switches automatically between second- and fourth-order approximations and that can be applied also when the local radius of curvature is of the order of the grid spacing.},

@article{Weymouth2011JCP,
	abstract = {A new robust and accurate Cartesian-grid treatment for the immersion of solid bodies within a fluid with general boundary conditions is described. The new approach, the Boundary Data Immersion Method (BDIM), is derived based on a general integration kernel formulation which allows the field equations of each domain and the interfacial conditions to be combined analytically. The resulting governing equation for the complete domain preserves the behavior of the original system in an efficient Cartesian-grid method, includ- ing stable and accurate pressure values on the solid boundary. The kernel formulation allows a detailed analysis of the method, and it is demonstrated that BDIM is consistent, obtains second-order convergence relative to the kernel width, and is robust with respect to the grid and boundary alignment. Formulation for no-slip and free slip boundary condi- tions are derived and numerical results are obtained for the flow past a cylinder and the impact of blunt bodies through a free surface. The BDIM predictions are compared to ana- lytic, experimental and previous numerical results confirming the properties, efficiency and efficacy of this new boundary treatment for Cartesian grid methods.},

@article{Wibawa2012,
	abstract = {If a moving body were made to vanish within a fluid, its boundary-layer vorticity would be released into the fluid at all locations simultaneously, a phenomenon we call global vorticity shedding. We approximate this process by studying the related problem of rapid vorticity transfer from the boundary layer of a body undergoing a quick change of cross-sectional and surface area. A surface-piercing foil is first towed through water at constant speed, , and constant angle of attack, then rapidly pulled out of the fluid in the spanwise direction. Viewed within a fixed plane perpendicular to the span, the cross-sectional area of the foil seemingly disappears. The rapid spanwise motion results in the nearly instantaneous shedding of the boundary layer into the surrounding fluid. Particle image velocimetry measurements show that the shed layers quickly transition from free shear layers to form two strong, unequal-strength vortices, formed within non-dimensional time , based on the foil chord and forward velocity. These vortices are connected to, and interact with, the foil's tip vortex through additional streamwise vorticity formed during the rapid pulling of the foil. Numerical simulations show that two strong spanwise vortices form from the shed vorticity of the boundary layer. The three-dimensional effects of the foil removal process are restricted to the tip of the foil. This method of vorticity transfer may be used for quickly introducing circulation to a fluid to provide forcing for biologically inspired flow control.},

	abstract = {The meshless local Petrov--Galerkin (MLPG) primitive variable based method is extended to analyze the incompressible laminar fluid flow within or over some different two-dimensional geometries. Although still in laminar regions, the Reynolds numbers considered in this study are in the ranges for which, in the literature, the MLPG primitive variable based method has never produced stable solutions and comparable results with those of the conventional methods. The considered test problems include, a steady lid-driven cavity flow with Reynolds numbers up to and including 10,000, a flow over a backward-facing step at 800 Reynolds number, and a transient fluid flow past a circular cylinder with Reynolds numbers up to and including 200. The present method solves the incompressible Navier--Stokes (N--S) equations in terms of the primitive variables using the characteristic-based split (CBS) scheme for discretization. The weighting function in the weak formulation of the governing equations is taken as unity, and the field variables are approximated using the moving least square (MLS) interpolation. For validation purposes, the obtained results are compared with those of the conventional numerical methods. The agreements of the compared results reveal a step forward towards further applications of the MLPG primitive variable based approach.},

@article{Landrini2012,
	abstract = {The free surface bow flow around a fast and fine ship in calm water is studied with an emphasis on generation and evolution of the breaking and splashing bow wave using the 2 D + t theory. A temporal domain-decomposition strategy is adopted which combines sequentially two Lagrangian methods: a potential-flow solution, given by a boundary element method (BEM), follows the jet evolution up to the breaking and then initiates a rotational solution, provided by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The latter describes the splashing and the evolution of rotational flow structures generated during the evolution. The compound method is very efficient and proved to be able to capture the breaking features. A validation has been performed through comparison with experimental data and other numerical solutions available in the literature. The DDG51 vessel is used to carry on a parameter investigation in terms of the ship speed (Froude number) and surface tension. The analysis confirms a substantial influence of the Froude number on the patterned morphology and highlights the importance of surface tension for small-scale ships (e.g. small-scale models tested in towing tanks) in inhibiting the jet formation and evolution.},

@conference{Weymouth2012FCP,
	abstract = {We present the concepts of physics-based learning models (PBLM) and their relevance and application to the field of ship hydrodynamics. The utility of physics-based
learning is motivated by contrasting generic learning models for regression predictions, which do not presume any knowledge of the system other than the training data
provided with methods such as semi-empirical models, which incorporate physical
insights along with data-fitting. PBLM provides a framework wherein intermediate
models, which capture (some) physical aspects of the problem, are incorporated into
modern generic learning tools to substantially improve the predictions of the latter,
minimizing the reliance on costly experimental measurements or high-resolution highfidelity numerical solutions. To illustrate the versatility and efficacy of PBLM, we
present three wave-ship interaction problems: 1) at speed waterline profiles; 2) ship
motions in head seas; and 3) three-dimensional breaking bow waves. PBLM is shown
to be robust and produce error rates at or below the uncertainty in the generated data
at a small fraction of the expense of high-resolution numerical predictions},

	abstract = {In this paper, noniterative interface reconstruction algorithms for volume of fluid (VOF) method are presented. Analytical expressions are derived to determine the coefficients of the curve to achieve a noniterative reconstruction procedure. Static interface reconstruction tests of standard geometries like circle and ellipse are performed. The noniterative algorithm based on Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation from an earlier work is found to reconstruct the VOF value within machine tolerance. Two piecewise continuous algorithms are also proposed in this work, which ensures C0 continuity. The first algorithm, namely, Piecewise Continuous Linear Interface Calculation (PCLIC), uses piecewise continuous linear segments to approximate the interface. The second algorithm uses piecewise continuous quadratic curve and is named as Piecewise Continuous Quadratic Interface Calculation. PCLIC is seen to achieve machine tolerance in reconstructing the VOF value. Piecewise Continuous Quadratic Interface Calculation is found to give a more accurate estimate of the length of the interface than Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation and PCLIC.

	abstract = {In this work a cephalopod-like deformable body that fills an internal cavity with fluid and expels it to propel an escape manoeuvre, while undergoing a drastic external shape change through shrinking, is shown to employ viscous as well as mainly inviscid hydrodynamic mechanisms to power an impressively fast start. First, we show that recovery of added-mass energy enables a shrinking rocket in a dense inviscid flow to achieve greater escape speed than an identical rocket in a vacuum. Next, we extend the shrinking body results of Weymouth & Triantafyllou (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 702, 2012, pp. 470--487) to three-dimensional bodies and show that three hydrodynamic mechanisms must be combined to achieve rapid escape performance in a viscous fluid: added-mass energy recovery; flow separation elimination; and an optimized energy storage and recovery. In particular, we show that the mechanism of separation elimination achieved through rapid body shrinking, coordinated with the mechanism of recovering the initially imparted added-mass energy, is critical to achieving a high escape speed. Hence a flexible, collapsing body can be vastly superior to a rigid-shell jet-propelled body.},

	abstract = {We present the concepts of physics-based learning models (PBLM) and their relevance and application to the field of ship hydrodynamics. The utility of physics-based
learning is motivated by contrasting generic learning models for regression predictions, which do not presume any knowledge of the system other than the training data
provided with methods such as semi-empirical models, which incorporate physical
insights along with data-fitting. PBLM provides a framework wherein intermediate
models, which capture (some) physical aspects of the problem, are incorporated into
modern generic learning tools to substantially improve the predictions of the latter,
minimizing the reliance on costly experimental measurements or high-resolution highfidelity numerical solutions. To illustrate the versatility and efficacy of PBLM, we
present three wave-ship interaction problems: 1) at speed waterline profiles; 2) ship
motions in head seas; and 3) three-dimensional breaking bow waves. PBLM is shown
to be robust and produce error rates at or below the uncertainty in the generated data
at a small fraction of the expense of high-resolution numerical predictions},

	abstract = {2D+T models for the approximate solution of ship divergent waves are of interest because of the orders of magnitude speed-up that they enable. Nonlinear ship bow waves of slender high-speed vessels are investigated using 2D+T and three-dimensional Cartesian-grid simulations using the conservative Volume-of-Fluid and Boundary Data Immersion Methods to model the fluid and solid interfaces. The formulation of the unsteady two-dimensional problem in this framework is detailed and the results are shown to be quantitatively accurate only when the ship is sufficiently slender and moving at high-speed. The class of bow wave; i.e. non-breaking, spilling, or plunging: is correctly predicted by 2D+T but the location of breaking is not. These deficiencies are overcome to some extent using a Physics- Based Learning Model, which supplements the high-speed 2D+T predictions with a limited set of three-dimensional examples to produce accurate quantitative predictions.},

@article{Weymouth2014JFM,
	abstract = { ABSTRACT In this paper I consider the self-excited rotation of an elliptical cylinder towed in a viscous fluid as a canonical model of nonlinear fluid--structure interactions with possible applications in the design of sensors and energy extraction devices. First, the self-excited ellipse system is shown to be analogous to the forced bistable oscillators studied in classic chaos theory. A single variable, the distance between the pivot and the centroid, governs the system bifurcation into bistability. Next, fully coupled computational fluid dynamics simulations of the motion of the cylinder demonstrate limit cycle, period doubling, intermittently chaotic and fully chaotic dynamics as the distance is further adjusted. The viscous wake behind the cylinder is presented for the limit-cycle cases and new types of stable wakes are characterized for each. In contrast, a chaotic case demonstrates an independence of the wake and structural states. The rotational kinetic energy is quantified and correlated to the vortex shedding and the trajectory periodicity. Chaotic and high-period system responses are found to persist when structural damping is applied and for Reynolds numbers as low as 200. },

@article{Polet2015,
	abstract = {A perching bird is able to rapidly decelerate while maintaining lift and control, but
the underlying aerodynamic mechanism is poorly understood. In this work we perform
a study on a simultaneously decelerating and pitching aerofoil section to increase
our understanding of the unsteady aerodynamics of perching. We first explore the
problem analytically, developing expressions for the added-mass and circulatory
forces arising from boundary-layer separation on a flat-plate aerofoil. Next, we study
the model problem through a detailed series of experiments at Re = 22 000 and
two-dimensional simulations at Re = 2000. Simulated vorticity fields agree with
particle image velocimetry measurements, showing the same wake features and
vorticity magnitudes. Peak lift and drag forces during rapid perching are measured
to be more than 10 times the quasi-steady values. The majority of these forces can
be attributed to added-mass energy transfer between the fluid and aerofoil, and to
energy lost to the fluid by flow separation at the leading and trailing edges. Thus,
despite the large angles of attack and decreasing flow velocity, this simple pitch-up
manoeuvre provides a means through which a perching bird can maintain high lift
and drag simultaneously while slowing to a controlled stop.},

@article{Triantafyllou2016,
	abstract = { The fluid mechanics employed by aquatic animals in their escape or attack maneuvers, what we call survival hydrodynamics, are fascinating because the recorded performance in animals is truly impressive. Such performance forces us to pose some basic questions on the underlying flow mechanisms that are not yet in use in engineered vehicles. A closely related issue is the ability of animals to sense the flow velocity and pressure field around them in order to detect and discriminate threats in environments where vision or other sensing is of limited or no use. We review work on animal flow sensing and actuation as a source of inspiration and as a way to formulate a number of basic problems and investigate the flow mechanisms that enable animals to perform these remarkable maneuvers. We also describe some intriguing mechanisms of actuation and sensing. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics Volume 48 is January 03, 2016. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates. },
